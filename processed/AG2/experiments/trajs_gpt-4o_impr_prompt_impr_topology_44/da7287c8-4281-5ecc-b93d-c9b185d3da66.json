We'll calculate the total earnings from each and then sum them up.\n\n1. Calculate the earnings from milkshakes:\n   - Price per milkshake: $5.50\n   - Number of milkshakes sold: 6\n\n2. Calculate the earnings from burger platters:\n   - Price per burger platter: $11.5\n   - Number of burger platters sold: 9\n\n3. Calculate the earnings from sodas:\n   - Price per soda: $1.50\n   - Number of sodas sold: Half of 40 = 20\n\nThen, sum up all these earnings to get the total money Terry makes.\n\n```python\n# Prices and quantities\nmilkshake_price = 5.50\nburger_platter_price = 11.50\nsoda_price = 1.50\n\nmilkshakes_sold = 6\nburger_platters_sold = 9\nsodas_sold = 40 / 2  # Half of 40 sodas\n\n# Calculate total earnings\ntotal_earnings = (milkshake_price * milkshakes_sold) + \\\n                 (burger_platter_price * burger_platters_sold) + \\\n                 (soda_price * sodas_sold)\n\nprint(total_earnings)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Milkshakes:\n   - Terry sells 6 milkshakes.\n   - Each milkshake costs $5.50.\n   - Total from milkshakes: \\( 6 \\times 5.50 \\).\n\n2. Burger Platters:\n   - Terry sells 9 burger platters.\n   - Each burger platter costs $11.50.\n   - Total from burger platters: \\( 9 \\times 11.50 \\).\n\n3. Sodas:\n   - Terry sells half of 40 sodas, which equals 20 sodas.\n   - Each soda costs $1.50.\n   - Total from sodas: \\( 20 \\times 1.50 \\).\n\nNow, calculate the total earnings:\n- Total from milkshakes = \\( 6 \\times 5.50 = 33.00 \\)\n- Total from burger platters = \\( 9 \\times 11.50 = 103.50 \\)\n- Total from sodas = \\( 20 \\times 1.50 = 30.00 \\)\n\nFinally, sum them up to obtain the total revenue:\n\\[ 33.00 + 103.50 + 30.00 = 166.50 \\]\n\nSo, Terry makes a total of $166.50.\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Verifier"
