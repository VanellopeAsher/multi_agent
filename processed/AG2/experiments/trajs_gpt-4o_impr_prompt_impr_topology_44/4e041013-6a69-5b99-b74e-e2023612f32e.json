In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To determine how many rows of tulips Jackson will end up planting, we'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Number of Rows for Red Tulips**:\n   - Jackson has 36 red tulips.\n   - He can fit 6 red tulips per row.\n   - To find the number of rows of red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips per row:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rows for red tulips} = \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\text{ rows}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Rows for Blue Tulips**:\n   - Jackson has 24 blue tulips.\n   - He can fit 8 blue tulips per row.\n   - To find the number of rows of blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips per row:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of rows for blue tulips} = \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\text{ rows}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Number of Rows**:\n   - Since the red and blue tulips are planted in separate rows, the total number of rows Jackson will plant is the sum of the rows for each color:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total number of rows} = 6 \\text{ (red rows) } + 3 \\text{ (blue rows) } = 9 \\text{ rows}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Jackson will end up planting a total of 9 rows of tulips. Now let's discuss or verify this solution with the team."
