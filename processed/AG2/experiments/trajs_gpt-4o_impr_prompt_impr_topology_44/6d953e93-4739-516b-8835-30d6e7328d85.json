  "problem": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.  On Thursday, the mechanic repairs 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  On Friday, the mechanic repairs some car tries and doesn't repair any truck tires.  The mechanic earns 40 more on Thursday than on Friday, how many car tires does the machanic repair on Friday?",

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate Earnings on Thursday**:  \n   - The mechanic charges $60 per truck tire and repairs 6 truck tires.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings from truck tires} = 6 \\times 60 = 360 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - The mechanic charges $40 per car tire and repairs 4 car tires.\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings from car tires} = 4 \\times 40 = 160 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n   - Total earnings on Thursday:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Earnings on Thursday} = 360 + 160 = 520 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Define Friday's Earnings and Solve for the Number of Car Tires**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of car tires repaired on Friday.\n   - The mechanic charges $40 per car tire, so earnings on Friday are:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Earnings on Friday} = 40x\n     \\]\n   - According to the problem, the mechanic earns $40 more on Thursday than on Friday:\n     \\[\n     520 = 40x + 40\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the Equation**:\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     520 = 40x + 40\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 40 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     520 - 40 = 40x\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     480 = 40x\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 40 to solve for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{480}{40} = 12\n     \\]\n\nThus, the mechanic repairs 12 car tires on Friday."
