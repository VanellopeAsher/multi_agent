      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of wheels required to assemble the toys and then adjust that number based on the remaining wheels in the box. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Wheels Needed for Cars:**\n   - Each car requires 4 wheels.\n   - With 57 cars, the total wheels needed for cars is:\n     \\[\n     57 \\times 4 = 228 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Total Wheels Needed for Motorcycles:**\n   - Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.\n   - With 73 motorcycles, the total wheels needed for motorcycles is:\n     \\[\n     73 \\times 2 = 146 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Total Wheels Required for All Toys:**\n   - Add the wheels needed for cars and motorcycles:\n     \\[\n     228 + 146 = 374 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine Initial Total Wheels in the Box:**\n   - We are told there are 276 wheels left in the box after assembling the toys.\n   - Hence, the initial number of wheels in the box is the total required plus the remaining:\n     \\[\n     374 + 276 = 650 \\text{ wheels}\n     \\]\n\nThus, the initial number of wheels in the box was 650 wheels.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"

Here is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_initial_wheels():\n    # Define the number of cars and motorcycles\n    num_cars = 57\n    num_motorcycles = 73\n    \n    # Define wheels needed per car and per motorcycle\n    wheels_per_car = 4\n    wheels_per_motorcycle = 2\n    \n    # Calculate the total wheels required for cars and motorcycles\n    total_wheels_cars = num_cars * wheels_per_car\n    total_wheels_motorcycles = num_motorcycles * wheels_per_motorcycle\n    \n    # Total wheels required\n    total_wheels_required = total_wheels_cars + total_wheels_motorcycles\n    \n    # Wheels left in the box after assembly\n    wheels_left = 276\n    \n    # Calculate the initial number of wheels in the box\n    initial_wheels_in_box = total_wheels_required + wheels_left\n    \n    return initial_wheels_in_box\n\n# Call the function and print the result\ninitial_wheels = calculate_initial_wheels()\ninitial_wheels\n```\n\nRunning this code gives us the initial number of wheels in the box.\n\nUpon executing the code, the result is that the initial number of wheels in the box is indeed **650**. \n\nThus, the solution is consistent with the calculation: the box originally contained 650 wheels."
