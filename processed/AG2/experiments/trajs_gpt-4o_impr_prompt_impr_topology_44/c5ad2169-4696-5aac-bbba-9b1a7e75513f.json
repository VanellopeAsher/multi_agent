In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Coral Pieces: 3 pieces at $2.00 each = \\(3 \\times 2.00\\)\n4. Fish: 20 fish at $0.50 each = \\(20 \\times 0.50\\)\n5. Fish Food: $2.00\n\nNow, I'll compute the total amount using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculating the total cost of each item\nfish_tank = 10.00\nstones = 2 * 2.50\ncoral_pieces = 3 * 2.00\nfish = 20 * 0.50\nfish_food = 2.00\n\n# Calculating the total expenditure\ntotal_spent = fish_tank + stones + coral_pieces + fish + fish_food\n\n# Print the total amount spent\nprint(total_spent)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
