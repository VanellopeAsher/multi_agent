The mean (average) is calculated by summing all the numbers in the set and then dividing by the number of elements in the set.\n\nLet's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Count the number of known scores**:  \n   Sally has scores from 8 quizzes and 1 forgotten score, making it 9 scores in total.\n\n2. **Calculate the total sum needed for an average of 70**:  \n   Since there are 9 quizzes in total, and the average score is 70, the total sum of the scores should be:\n   \\[\n   9 \\times 70 = 630\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum the known scores**:  \n   The known scores are 50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70.  \n   \\[\n   50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 = 570\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the forgotten score**:  \n   Let \\( x \\) represent the forgotten score. According to our calculation:\n   \\[\n   570 + x = 630\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 630 - 570 = 60\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the forgotten score is 60. \n\nLet's discuss this method or approach if there are any alternative ideas or confirm its correctness with the other agents."
