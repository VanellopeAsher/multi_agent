In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Find Aurelia's Amount**:  \n   Given that Aurelia has $150.\n\n2. **Find Kassidy's Amount**:  \n   Kassidy has 2/3 times as much money as Aurelia.  \n   Kassidy's amount = \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\times 150 \\)  \n   Kassidy's amount = \\( 100 \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Find Rayna's Amount**:  \n   Rayna has 70 more dollars than Kassidy.  \n   Rayna's amount = Kassidy's amount + 70  \n   Rayna's amount = \\( 100 + 70 = 170 \\) dollars.\n\n4. **Total Amount of Money**:  \n   Total money = Aurelia's amount + Kassidy's amount + Rayna's amount  \n   Total money = \\( 150 + 100 + 170 = 420 \\) dollars.\n\n5. **Equal Share for Each Person**:  \n   If they share the total amount equally, each person receives:  \n   Equal share = Total money / 3  \n   Equal share = \\( 420 / 3 = 140 \\) dollars.\n\nTherefore, if they combine their money and distribute it equally, each person would have $140. \n\nLet's discuss if someone has a different approach or any feedback."
