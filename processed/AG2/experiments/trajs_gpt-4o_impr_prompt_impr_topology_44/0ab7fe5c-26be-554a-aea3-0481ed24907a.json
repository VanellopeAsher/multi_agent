      "content": "To solve this problem, I'll go step-by-step:\n\n1. **Calculate the Number of Red Tulips:**\n   - Jackson buys 3.6 times of ten red tulips. Therefore, the number of red tulips he buys is: \n     \\[\n     3.6 \\times 10 = 36 \\text{ red tulips}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Blue Tulips:**\n   - Jackson buys 2.4 times of ten blue tulips. Therefore, the number of blue tulips he buys is:\n     \\[\n     2.4 \\times 10 = 24 \\text{ blue tulips}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Rows for Red Tulips:**\n   - He can fit 6 red tulips in a row. So, the number of rows needed for red tulips is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\text{ rows of red tulips}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Rows for Blue Tulips:**\n   - He can fit 8 blue tulips in a row. So, the number of rows needed for blue tulips is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{24}{8} = 3 \\text{ rows of blue tulips}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Total Number of Rows Planted:**\n   - Add the number of rows for both red and blue tulips:\n     \\[\n     6 + 3 = 9 \\text{ rows of flowers}\n     \\]\n\nThus, Jackson will plant a total of 9 rows of flowers."
