The sightseeing time was then determined by subtracting the time spent on other activities (15 hours) from the total vacation time (50 hours), resulting in 35 hours of sightseeing.\n\n- Agent Code Executor implemented a similar calculation in Python code, which confirmed the outcome of 35 hours of sightseeing.\n\nThus, the solution is consistent and correctly computed.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{35}**"
