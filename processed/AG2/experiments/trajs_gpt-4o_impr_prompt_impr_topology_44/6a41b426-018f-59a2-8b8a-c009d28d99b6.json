      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many miles John runs on each of the 3 days, given that he runs a total of 60 miles a week, and on two of those days, he runs half as much as on the other day.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Define Variables**:\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of miles John runs on the one day he runs the most.\n   - On the other two days, he runs half as much, so each of those days, he runs \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) miles.\n\n2. **Formulate the Equation**:\n   - The total miles he runs per week equals the miles he runs over the 3 days, so:  \n   \\[\n   x + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} = 60\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify and Solve the Equation**:\n   - Combine the terms on the left side:\n   \\[\n   x + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{x}{2} = x + x = 2x\n   \\]\n   - Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   2x = 60\n   \\]\n   - Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 30\n   \\]\n\nThis means John runs 30 miles on the day he runs the most and 15 miles each on the other two days (because \\( \\frac{x}{2} = 15 \\)).\n\nIn conclusion, John runs:\n- 30 miles on one day, and\n- 15 miles on each of the other two days. \n \nThis adds up to a total of 60 miles per week as expected."
