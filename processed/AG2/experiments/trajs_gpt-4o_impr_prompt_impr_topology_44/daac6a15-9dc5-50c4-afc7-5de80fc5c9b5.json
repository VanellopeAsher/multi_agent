We'll call this number \\( D \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Total Number of Doughnuts Sold in June**:  \n   Since there are 30 days, the total number of doughnuts sold is \\( 30 \\times D \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Earnings**:  \n   Since each doughnut sells for $2, the total earnings from doughnut sales in June is \\( 30 \\times D \\times 2 = 60 \\times D \\) dollars.\n\nWithout the exact number of doughnuts sold per day (\\( D \\)), we can express the monthly earnings as \\( 60 \\times D \\). Once \\( D \\) is known, the exact earnings can be calculated. If more information is provided regarding how many doughnuts Derrick sells each day, feel free to share it so we can compute the exact figures."

Assuming Derrick bakes and sells an average of 100 doughnuts per day, here's how we can proceed:\n\nUsing the assumed daily sales of 100 doughnuts:\n\n1. **Identify the Daily Sales**:  \n   We assume \\( D = 100 \\) doughnuts per day.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Earnings in June**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Earnings} = 60 \\times 100 = 6000 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nThis means if Derrick's bakery sells 100 doughnuts every day in June, he makes $6,000 from doughnut sales.\n\nFeel free to adjust the daily sales number and we can compute the corresponding earnings.
