Kate took the crayons home and decided to make crayon muffins by melting 8 small pieces of crayons together in a muffin tin that she placed in an oven for a few minutes.

      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Calculate Total Number of Crayons:**\n   - Kate received 3 boxes of crayons.\n   - Each box contains 64 crayons.\n   - Therefore, the total number of crayons = 3 boxes * 64 crayons per box = 192 crayons.\n\n2. **Determine Number of Muffin Crayons:**\n   - Each muffin crayon is made by melting 8 small pieces of crayons.\n   - So, the number of muffin crayons that can be made = Total crayons / Crayons per muffin = 192 / 8 = 24 muffin crayons.\n\n3. **Calculate the Selling Price of Each Muffin Crayon:**\n   - Kate sold all her muffin crayons for $36.\n   - Therefore, the selling price of each muffin crayon = Total sales / Number of muffin crayons = $36 / 24 = $1.50 per muffin crayon.\n\nThus, each muffin crayon sells for $1.50. \n\nNow I will share my solution logic and reasoning with the team for further discussion or input if needed."

The calculations for the total number of crayons, the number of muffin crayons, and the selling price per muffin crayon are correct:\n\n1. Total number of crayons given was 3 boxes of 64 crayons each, amounting to 192 crayons.\n2. Kate created muffin crayons, each using 8 crayons, resulting in \\( \\frac{192}{8} = 24 \\) muffin crayons.\n3. Selling all muffin crayons for $36 gives a price of \\( \\frac{36}{24} = 1.50 \\) per muffin crayon.\n\nThus, the correct price per muffin crayon is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{1.50}**"
