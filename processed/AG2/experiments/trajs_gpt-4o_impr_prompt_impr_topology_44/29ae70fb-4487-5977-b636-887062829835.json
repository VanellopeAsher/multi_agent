      "content": "To determine how many Karate classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we first calculate the cost per class if he attends all classes, and then see how it changes as he misses classes.\n\n1. Calculate the cost per class if Manny attends all the classes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per class} = \\frac{\\text{Total cost of classes}}{\\text{Total classes attended}}\n   \\]\n   With all 10 classes attended:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cost per class} = \\frac{60}{10} = 6 \\text{ dollars per class}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the cost per class as Manny starts missing classes:\n   We need to find the maximum number of classes he can miss while keeping the cost per class at $10 or below.\n\n   Since the cost per class should ideally not exceed $10:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{60}{\\text{Classes attended}} \\leq 10\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve the inequality to decide the minimum number of classes he must attend:\n   \\[\n   60 \\leq 10 \\times \\text{Classes attended}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Classes attended} \\geq \\frac{60}{10} = 6\n   \\]\n\n   This means Manny needs to attend at least 6 classes to ensure the cost per class does not exceed $10.\n\n4. Calculate the number of classes he can miss:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Classes he can miss} = 10 - 6 = 4\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Manny can miss up to 4 Karate classes before his parents decide not to sign him up again."

The total cost for Karate classes is $60, and the maximum allowable cost per class is $10.\n2. Manny needs to ensure each class costs no more than $10 to avoid parental disapproval.\n3. He must attend a minimum of 6 classes for the cost to remain within his parents' approval.\n4. Therefore, Manny can miss a maximum of 4 classes while keeping the cost at or below $10 per class.\n\nThus, the final solution is:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{4}**"
