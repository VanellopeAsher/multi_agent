Assign Monday's water depth.\n2. Calculate Tuesday's water depth by adding 7 feet.\n3. Calculate Wednesday's water depth as two-thirds of Tuesday's depth.\n4. Determine the increase on Thursday as half the difference between Tuesday's and Wednesday's depths.\n5. Compute the final water depth on Thursday.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation.\n\n```python\n# Assign Monday's water depth\nmonday_depth = 17\n\n# Calculate Tuesday's water depth\ntuesday_depth = monday_depth + 7\n\n# Calculate Wednesday's water depth\nwednesday_depth = (2/3) * tuesday_depth\n\n# Calculate the increase on Thursday\nincrease_thursday = (tuesday_depth - wednesday_depth) / 2\n\n# Calculate Thursday's water depth\nthursday_depth = wednesday_depth + increase_thursday\n\n# Print the final result\nprint(thursday_depth)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
