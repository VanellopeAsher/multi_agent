I'll use the data provided, which indicates that at this party, three women are wearing 4.5-inch heels and three others are wearing 2.5-inch heels. Here's how we can compute it:\n\n```python\n# Number of women and heel heights\nnum_heels_4_5 = 3\nheight_heels_4_5 = 4.5\nnum_heels_2_5 = 3\nheight_heels_2_5 = 2.5\n\n# Total height contributed by each type of heel\ntotal_height_4_5 = num_heels_4_5 * height_heels_4_5\ntotal_height_2_5 = num_heels_2_5 * height_heels_2_5\n\n# Total number of women wearing heels\ntotal_women = num_heels_4_5 + num_heels_2_5\n\n# Sum of all heel heights\ntotal_height = total_height_4_5 + total_height_2_5\n\n# Average height\naverage_height = total_height / total_women\n\n# Print the average height\nprint(average_height)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"

Let's verify their contributions:\n\n1. **Agent Problem Solver's Solution**:\n    - They calculated the total height from the 4.5-inch heels as \\(3 \\times 4.5 = 13.5\\) inches.\n    - They calculated the total height from the 2.5-inch heels as \\(3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5\\) inches.\n    - The sum of all the heel heights is \\(13.5 + 7.5 = 21\\) inches.\n    - With 6 women wearing the heels in total, the average heel height is \\(\\frac{21}{6} = 3.5\\) inches.\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor's Solution**:\n    - The Python code successfully replicated the calculation's steps and produced an output of 3.5 after computation.\n\nBoth approaches have arrived at the solution of 3.5 inches for the average height of the heels at the party. The calculations have been confirmed to be correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{3.5}**"
