      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of bags that the trader sold in order to make a profit of $400. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Definitions and Rates:**\n   - Cost price of one bag = $20\n   - Transport cost per bag = $2\n   - Total cost per bag = $20 + $2 = $22\n   - Selling price per bag = $30\n\n2. **Profit Calculation:**\n   - Profit per bag = Selling price per bag - Total cost per bag\n   - Profit per bag = $30 - $22 = $8\n\n3. **Total Profit:**\n   - Total profit = $400 \n\n4. **Calculating Number of Bags Sold:**\n   - We know the trader made a total profit of $400, and the profit for each bag sold is $8.\n   - Therefore, the number of bags sold (let's call it `n`) can be calculated by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:\n   - \\( n = \\frac{\\text{Total Profit}}{\\text{Profit per bag}} = \\frac{400}{8} = 50 \\)\n\nThus, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.\n\n---\n\nNow that I've presented my solution, let's discuss this with the team and verify it to ensure accuracy."
