      "content": "To solve the problem of determining how many total action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we need to consider the constraints and details provided:\n\n1. **Distributing the Total Money**: Peter has a total of $70 and wishes to spend an equal amount each day over the course of one week (7 days). Therefore, the amount of money he will spend each day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily spending} = \\frac{\\$70}{7} = \\$10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Purchasing Wooden Action Figures**: From Sunday through Wednesday (4 days), Peter buys wooden action figures at a cost of $5 each. Thus, the number of wooden figures he can purchase per day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Wooden figures per day} = \\frac{\\$10}{\\$5} = 2\n   \\]\n   Over 4 days (Sunday to Wednesday), the total number of wooden action figures is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total wooden figures} = 2 \\times 4 = 8\n   \\]\n\n3. **Purchasing Plastic Action Figures**: From Thursday to Saturday (3 days), he buys plastic action figures at a cost of $2.5 each. So, the number of plastic figures he can purchase per day is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Plastic figures per day} = \\frac{\\$10}{\\$2.5} = 4\n   \\]\n   Over 3 days (Thursday to Saturday), the total number of plastic action figures is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total plastic figures} = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Total Number of Action Figures**: \n   Add both the wooden and plastic figures to get the overall total:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total action figures} = 8 \\, (\\text{wooden}) + 12 \\, (\\text{plastic}) = 20\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 20 action figures. \n\nLet's discuss if we have any other perspectives or calculations."

Following the detailed breakdown:\n\n1. Calculate the daily spending and then determine the number of action figures (both wooden and plastic) that can be purchased within the daily budget over the specified days.\n2. Sum up the total number of each type of figure over the corresponding days.\n\nThe final result is 20 action figures.
