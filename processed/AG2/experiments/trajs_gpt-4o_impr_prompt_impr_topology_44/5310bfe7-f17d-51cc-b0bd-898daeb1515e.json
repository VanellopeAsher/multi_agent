      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many goals each teenager scored and then add them together to find the total number of goals scored by all three. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Identify the known information:**\n   - Richie scored 90 goals.\n   - Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark.\n   - Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna.\n\n2. **Set up equations based on the given information:**\n   - Let \\( M \\) be the number of goals scored by Mark.\n   - Let \\( A \\) be the number of goals scored by Anna.\n   - Since Richie scored 30 more goals than Mark, we have the equation:\n     \\[\n     R = M + 30\n     \\]\n   - Since Richie scored 55 more goals than Anna, we have the equation:\n     \\[\n     R = A + 55\n     \\]\n   - We also know Richie scored 90 goals:\n     \\[\n     R = 90\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the equations for Mark and Anna's goals:**\n   - Substitute \\( R = 90 \\) into the equations:\n     \\[\n     90 = M + 30 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad M = 90 - 30 = 60\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     90 = A + 55 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad A = 90 - 55 = 35\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total goals scored by all three teenagers:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total goals} = R + M + A = 90 + 60 + 35 = 185\n   \\]\n\nThus, all three teenagers scored a total of 185 goals."
