      "content": "Let's tackle this problem with a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Define the Total Number of Students:**\n   - Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \\( x \\).\n\n2. **Determine the Students With and Without Computers:**\n   - According to the problem, two-thirds of the students have a desktop computer at home.\n   - Therefore, the number of students with desktop computers is \\(\\frac{2}{3}x\\).\n   - The remaining students, which is the rest one-third of the students, do not have desktop computers.\n   - Therefore, the number of students without desktop computers is \\(\\frac{1}{3}x\\).\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation Based on Given Information:**\n   - We know from the problem statement that the number of students without desktop computers is 30. Thus, we can set up the following equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3}x = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for the Total Number of Students \\( x \\):**\n   - To find \\( x \\), multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 30 \\times 3 = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere are 90 students at that grade level. \n\nI look forward to discussing this approach with the team or addressing any questions or alternative solutions they might suggest."
