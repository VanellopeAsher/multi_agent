In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

      "content": "To find out how much Scarlett spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item she purchased and then add them all together. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Aquarium Cost**:  \n   Scarlett bought the aquarium for $10.00.\n\n2. **Cost of Rocks**:  \n   - Number of bags of rocks: 2\n   - Cost per bag: $2.50\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of rocks} = 2 \\times 2.50 = 5.00\n   \\]\n\n3. **Cost of Coral**:  \n   - Number of pieces of coral: 3\n   - Cost per piece: $2.00\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total cost of coral} = 3 \\times 2.00 = 6.00\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cost of Fish**:  \n   - While the problem states the number of fish purchased, it does not provide the cost per fish. Therefore, the calculation cannot include this expense unless further information is provided.\n   \n5. **Cost of Fish Food**:  \n   The cost of fish food is $2.00.\n\n6. **Total Cost**:  \n   Adding all these costs together gives us the total amount Scarlett spent. However, the cost of fish is missing from the calculation, because its price per fish isn't provided. Assuming we are calculating only the items with known costs:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total known cost} = 10.00 + 5.00 + 6.00 + 2.00 = 23.00\n   \\]\n\nIf further information is provided regarding the cost of the fish (price per fish, total cost, etc.), the total expenditure needs to be adjusted accordingly. For now, Scarlett's known expenditure is $23.00, not including the fish. \n\nLet's discuss any additional approach or information needed with the rest of the team."

Fish Food: $2.00\n\nSince there was no cost information for the fish, it was not included in the total.
