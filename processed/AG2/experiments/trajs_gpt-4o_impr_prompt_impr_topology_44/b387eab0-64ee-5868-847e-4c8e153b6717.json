If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, and they have a coupon that offers a 10% discount on the total price after cashback, how much will they pay for the gas after applying both the cashback and the coupon?",

Calculate the total cost for 10 gallons of gas at the regular price.\n2. Calculate the total cashback received.\n3. Calculate the effective cost after the cashback.\n4. Apply the 10% discount on the effective cost.\n5. Calculate the final amount to be paid.\n\nHere's the detailed Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\n# Define the prices and other constants\nprice_per_gallon = 3.00  # price per gallon in dollars\ncashback_per_gallon = 0.20  # cashback per gallon in dollars\ngallons_purchased = 10  # number of gallons\ndiscount_rate = 0.10  # discount rate as a decimal\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the regular total price for 10 gallons\ntotal_cost = price_per_gallon * gallons_purchased\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total cashback received\ntotal_cashback = cashback_per_gallon * gallons_purchased\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the effective cost after cashback\neffective_cost_after_cashback = total_cost - total_cashback\n\n# Step 4: Apply the 10% discount on the effective cost\ndiscount_amount = effective_cost_after_cashback * discount_rate\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final amount to be paid\nfinal_price = effective_cost_after_cashback - discount_amount\n\n# Display the final result\nprint(final_price)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
