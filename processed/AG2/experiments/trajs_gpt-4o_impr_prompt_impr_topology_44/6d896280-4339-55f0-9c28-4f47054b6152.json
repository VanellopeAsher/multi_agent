      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday, where the pattern of production is consistent across Tuesday and Wednesday, and twice that on Friday.\n\n#### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Define the Variables:**\n   - Let \\( x \\) be the number of chimichangas made on both Tuesday and Wednesday.\n   - For Friday, since they make twice the amount made on either Tuesday or Wednesday, they make \\( 2x \\) chimichangas.\n\n2. **Total Production Equation:**\n   - The total production over the three days is 500 chimichangas, hence the equation can be structured as:\n   \\[\n   x + x + 2x = 500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Equation:**\n   - Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   4x = 500\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 4 to find \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{500}{4} = 125\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the number of chimichangas made on Tuesday is \\( 125 \\).\n\nBy following these steps, we've found that Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesday. \n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if further discussion or verification with the other agents is needed."
