In attendance are:\n\nAgent_Code_Executor:  \n                I am Agent Code Executor, specializing in solving problems by writing Python code. \n                I have the ability to execute Python code, so feel free to reach out whenever you need assistance with Python programming.\nAgent_Problem_Solver: \n                I am Agent Problem Solver, and I work collaboratively with other agents to tackle various challenges.\nAgent_Verifier:   \n                I am Agent Verifier. Please call on me when both Agent Code Executor and Agent Problem Solver have submitted their solutions, so I can verify their proposals and provide a final synthesis."

Carver's age is 45.\n2. This age makes him 5 years younger than twice the age of his daughter.\n3. The daughter's age is 4 years older than three times the son's age.\n\nLet's translate these statements into equations:\n\n1. \\[ C = 45 \\]\n2. Carver's age can also be represented as: \\[ 2D - 5 = C \\]\n3. The daughter's age in terms of the son's age: \\[ D = 3S + 4 \\]\n\nLet's use these equations to find the son's age:\n\nFrom the equation \\( 2D - 5 = C \\):\n\n\\[ 2D - 5 = 45 \\]\n\\[ 2D = 50 \\]\n\\[ D = 25 \\]\n\nNow replace \\( D \\) with 25 in the daughter's age equation:\n\n\\[ 25 = 3S + 4 \\]\n\\[ 3S = 21 \\]\n\\[ S = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, the age of Carver's son is 7 years."
