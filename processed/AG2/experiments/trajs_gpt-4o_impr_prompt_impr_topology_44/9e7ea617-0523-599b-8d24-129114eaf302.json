      "content": "To solve the problem of determining the height of the tallest tree in Eddy's backyard, let's outline the solution step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Variables and Relations**:\n   - Let the height of the shortest tree be \\( h_1 = 60 \\) feet.\n   - The second tree is 50 feet taller than the shortest tree, so its height is \\( h_2 = h_1 + 50 \\).\n   - The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the shortest and the second tree.\n\n2. **Calculate the Height of the Second Tree**:\n   - Using the relation for the second tree, we have: \n     \\[\n     h_2 = 60 + 50 = 110 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Combined Height of the Shortest and Second Trees**:\n   - The combined height of the first two trees is: \n     \\[\n     h_1 + h_2 = 60 + 110 = 170 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Height of the Tallest Tree**:\n   - Since the tallest tree's height is twice the combined height of the first two trees, we have:\n     \\[\n     h_3 = 2 \\times (h_1 + h_2) = 2 \\times 170 = 340 \\text{ feet}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the tallest tree is 340 feet tall. \n\nNow that I have documented my solution, I would like to discuss this with the other agents to ensure that everything is correctly addressed."
