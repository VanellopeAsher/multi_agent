Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month.

      "content": "To address Jessica's financial query, we need to calculate the total amount she pays on her debts each month and extrapolate that over a year with the condition of paying 50% more than the minimum required amount. \n\nLet's break down the solution into steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Minimum Monthly Payments for Each Debt**:\n   - Student loans: $300\n   - Credit card: $200\n   - Mortgage: $500\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Minimum Monthly Payment for Debts**:\n   - Total minimum monthly payment = $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000\n\n3. **Calculate the Payment When Paying 50% More**:\n   - When Jessica pays 50% more than the minimum required, she will pay:\n   - Additional 50% of $1000 = $1000 * 0.5 = $500\n   - Total monthly payment = $1000 (minimum) + $500 (additional) = $1500\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Payment for Debts in a Year**:\n   - Total yearly payment = $1500 (monthly payment) * 12 months = $18000\n\nTherefore, Jessica pays $18,000 on her debts in a year when paying 50% more than the minimum required. \n\nRegarding her Netflix subscription and gym payment, those costs are not included in the debts calculation and thus are not relevant to this immediate question."
