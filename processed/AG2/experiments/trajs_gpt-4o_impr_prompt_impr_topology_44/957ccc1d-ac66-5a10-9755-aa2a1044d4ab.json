      "content": "To determine how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day to reach his weight loss goal by his birthday, we first calculate the total amount of weight he needs to lose, the total number of calories he needs to burn, and then find the daily calorie deficit.\n\n1. **Calculate the Weight Loss Goal:**\n   - Andy wants to lose 30 lbs.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Caloric Deficit Required:**\n   - It is estimated that burning 3,500 calories results in the loss of 1 pound.\n   - Therefore, to lose 30 lbs, Andy needs to burn:\n     \\[\n     30 \\, \\text{lbs} \\times 3,500 \\, \\text{calories/lb} = 105,000 \\, \\text{calories}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Timeframe:**\n   - Today is December 31st, and he wants to achieve this by July 19th.\n   - From January 1st to July 19th, the time span includes the entire month of January through June (6 months) and 19 days of July.\n   - Calculation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Months} = 6 \\, \\text{months} \\times 30 \\, \\text{days/month} = 180 \\, \\text{days (approximately)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total Days} = 180 \\, \\text{days} + 19 \\, \\text{days} = 199 \\, \\text{days}\n     \\]\n   (For more precision, calculate using the exact number of days in each month, considering January: 31, February: 28, March: 31, April: 30, May: 31, June: 30, and July: 19.)\n\n4. **Calculate the Daily Caloric Deficit:**\n   - With a total caloric burn requirement of 105,000 calories over 199 days, the daily caloric deficit should be:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{105,000 \\, \\text{calories}}{199 \\, \\text{days}} \\approx 527.64 \\, \\text{calories/day}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, Andy should aim for a daily calorie deficit of approximately 528 calories to reach his weight loss goal by July 19th."

Here's a breakdown of both approaches:\n\n1. **Agent Problem Solver's Approach:**\n   - Total weight to lose: 30 lbs\n   - Total calories to burn: 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories\n   - Total duration: December 31, 2023, to July 19, 2024.\n   - Total days calculated: 199 days \n   - Daily calorie deficit = 105,000 calories / 199 days ≈ 528 calories/day\n\n2. **Agent Code Executor's Approach:**\n   - Calculations based on the actual dates and the difference between December 31, 2023, and July 19, 2024.\n   - Total days calculated considering each month specifically ending up with a more precise day calculation.\n   - Result: 522 calories/day\n\nAfter reviewing both solutions, Agent Code Executor's approach provides a precise calculation of the days between the specified dates and subsequently the daily caloric deficit required. Therefore, the final verified average daily calorie deficit that Andy needs is **SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{522}**."
