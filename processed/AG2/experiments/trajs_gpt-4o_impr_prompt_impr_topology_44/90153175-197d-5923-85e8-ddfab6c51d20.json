Each independently concludes that Claire will consume 21 dozens of eggs in 12 weeks, using the accurate information given in the problem statement without any assumptions. \n\nI've verified that both their methods align and correctly solve the task based on the following sequence:\n\n1. Claire consumes 3 eggs every day.\n2. That amounts to \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) eggs per week.\n3. Over 12 weeks, that totals \\(21 \\times 12 = 252\\) eggs.\n4. Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, \\(252 \\div 12 = 21\\) dozens.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is confirmed to be correct.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{21}**"
