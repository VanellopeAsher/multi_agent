Here's a breakdown of their reasoning:\n\n1. **Classes Calculation**:\n   - Judy teaches 5 classes per day from Monday to Friday, resulting in a total of \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\) classes.\n   - On Saturday, she teaches 8 classes.\n   - The total number of classes per week is \\(25 + 8 = 33\\).\n\n2. **Students Calculation**:\n   - Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students across all classes is \\(33 \\times 15 = 495\\).\n\n3. **Earnings Calculation**:\n   - Judy charges $15.00 per student, leading to a total earning of \\(495 \\times 15 = \\$7,425.00\\).\n\nThe computations from Agent Problem Solver and the verification via Python by Agent Code Executor both conclude that Judy makes $7425.00 in one week.
