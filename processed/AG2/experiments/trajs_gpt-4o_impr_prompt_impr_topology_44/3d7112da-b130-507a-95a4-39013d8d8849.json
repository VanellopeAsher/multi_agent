      "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John spent on each activity and use the given percentages to find out the total time he spent on his vacation.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Boating and Swimming:**\n   - John spends 6.6 hours boating.\n   - He also spends half of his boating time swimming. So, the time spent swimming is \\(\\frac{6.6}{2} = 3.3\\) hours.\n\n2. **Time spent watching shows:**\n   - John watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2.5 hours.\n   - Total time spent watching shows is \\(3 \\times 2.5 = 7.5\\) hours.\n\n3. **Total time calculation:**\n   - We know that the time spent watching shows accounts for 30% of his total vacation time.\n   - Let the total time John spent on vacation be \\(T\\).\n   - So, \\(0.3T = 7.5\\).\n\n4. **Solve the equation to find the total time, \\(T\\):**\n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{7.5}{0.3} = 25 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**\n   - Sightseeing accounted for 40% of his total vacation time.\n   - Time spent sightseeing is \\(0.4T = 0.4 \\times 25 = 10\\) hours.\n\nThus, John spent 10 hours sightseeing during his vacation."
