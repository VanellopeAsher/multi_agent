      "content": "To solve this problem, let's break down the details step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem Requirements**:  \n   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes).\n   - A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 30 minutes to complete.\n   - An extreme sudoku puzzle takes 3 times the duration of a normal one.\n\n2. **Calculate the Time Taken for the Extreme Sudoku**:\n   - Since an extreme sudoku takes 3 times longer than a normal one, it requires \\(3 \\times 30\\) minutes.\n   - Thus, an extreme sudoku takes 90 minutes to complete.\n\n3. **Determine How Many Bottles of Water John Drinks**:\n   - John drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes.\n   - Over the course of 90 minutes, the intervals can be broken down as follows:\n     - 0-30 minutes: 1 bottle\n     - 30-60 minutes: 1 bottle\n     - 60-90 minutes: 1 bottle\n\n4. **Add Up the Bottles**:\n   - In total, John drinks 3 bottles of water over the 90-minute period.\n\nThus, during the time it takes to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle, John drinks 3 bottles of water. \n\nNow I will share my solution with the team for any further insights or discussions."

In the problem, it is stated that John drinks one bottle of water every 30 minutes.\n\nGiven that an extreme sudoku takes 90 minutes (3 times longer than the normal 30 minutes), we can easily calculate:\n\n- During these 90 minutes, John has three 30-minute intervals.\n- Thus, he drinks 3 bottles of water during this time.\n\nThe final solution is consistent between both agents and based on the provided information in the problem statement. Therefore, I can confirm the solution:\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{3}**"
