Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1. **List the Test Scores**:  \n   Wilson's test scores are: 70, 95, 88, 90, and 78.\n\n2. **Sum the Test Scores**:  \n   Add all the test scores together:  \n   \\(70 + 95 + 88 + 90 + 78 = 421\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the Average**:  \n   The average score is calculated by dividing the total sum of the scores by the number of tests:  \n   \\(\\text{Average} = \\frac{421}{5} = 84.2\\)\n\nTherefore, Wilson's current math grade, represented as the average of his test scores, is 84.2.\n\nNow, let's discuss with the other agents to confirm or discuss this approach."
