      "content": "To solve this problem, letâ€™s proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Known Values**: \n   - Length of one remora = 6 inches.\n   - There are 2 remoras, so the total combined length of the remoras = \\( 6 \\, \\text{inches} \\times 2 = 12 \\, \\text{inches} \\).\n\n2. **Use the Percentage Information**: \n   - Combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. This means:\n   \\[\n   12 = 0.10 \\times \\text{shark's length}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Formulate the Equation**:\n   - We need to solve for the shark's body length. Let \\( x \\) be the length of the shark in inches.\n   - Set up the equation from the given percentage:\n   \\[\n   12 = 0.10 \\times x\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Equation**: \n   - To find \\( x \\), divide both sides of the equation by 0.10:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{12}{0.10}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x = 120 \\, \\text{inches}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The shark is 120 inches long.\n\nI have formulated and outlined my solution above. Let's discuss the approach and verify the correctness."

Let's confirm this by running the necessary calculations using Python code. \n\nThe calculation is simple: \n- The combined length of the remoras is known (12 inches).\n- We know this length is 10% of the shark's length, so the shark's length is calculated as 12 divided by 0.10.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code to verify: \n\n```python\n# Variables\ncombined_remora_length = 6 * 2  # 6 inches each, 2 remoras\nremora_percentage_of_shark_length = 0.10\n\n# Calculate shark's length\nshark_length = combined_remora_length / remora_percentage_of_shark_length\n\nprint(shark_length)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
