Calculate the total number of balloons they started with: multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack.\n2. Determine the number of balloons thrown by subtracting the balloons left from the total number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of packs and balloons per pack\npacks = 10\nballoons_per_pack = 100\n\n# Calculate total number of balloons\ntotal_balloons = packs * balloons_per_pack\n\n# Balloons left at the end\nballoons_left = 120\n\n# Calculate the number of balloons thrown\nballoons_thrown = total_balloons - balloons_left\n\n# Print the result\nprint(balloons_thrown)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
