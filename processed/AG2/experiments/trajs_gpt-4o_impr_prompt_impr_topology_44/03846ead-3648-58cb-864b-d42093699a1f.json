Calculate the total points collected by all students.\n\n3. Determine how many more points are needed to reach the 500-point threshold for the field trip.\n\nI will write a Python code to compute the total points and how many points are needed for the trip. \n\n```python\n# Points collected by each student\nalex_points = 60\nbella_points = alex_points + alex_points * 0.3  # Bella collects 30% more than Alex\ntim_points = bella_points - 40                  # Tim has 40 points less than Bella\nmary_points = 3 * tim_points                    # Mary collects 3 times more than Tim\n\n# Total points of the class\ntotal_points = alex_points + bella_points + tim_points + mary_points\n\n# Field trip threshold\nthreshold = 500\n\n# Calculate the missing points for the field trip\nmissing_points = max(0, threshold - total_points)\n\nprint(missing_points)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
