Identify the items that qualify as food and those that do not.\n   - Food items: milk, eggs, cookies, and water.\n   - Non-food items: light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for food items (expenses without tax).\n   - Milk: $2\n   - Eggs: $3\n   - Cookies: $2\n   - Water: $1\n   - Total cost for food items = $2 + $3 + $2 + $1 = $8\n\n3. Calculate the total cost for non-food items and apply the 10% tax.\n   - Light bulbs: $3\n   - Cups: $3\n   - Roach traps: $4\n   - Total cost for non-food items before tax = $3 + $3 + $4 = $10\n   - Tax on non-food items = 10% of $10 = $1\n   - Total cost for non-food items with tax = $10 + $1 = $11\n\n4. Calculate the overall total cost by adding the total for food items and the total for taxed non-food items.\n   - Total cost = $8 (food items) + $11 (non-food items with tax) = $19\n\nThe total cost for all items, including the tax on non-food items, is $19."
