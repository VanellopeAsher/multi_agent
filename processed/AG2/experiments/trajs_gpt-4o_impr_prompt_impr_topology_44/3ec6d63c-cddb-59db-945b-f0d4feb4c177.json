To verify, let's calculate this using Python, making sure the calculations are accurate and the logic is consistent.\n\n```python\n# Given data\ntotal_deer = 80\npercent_bucks = 30\npercent_6_point_bucks = 50\n\n# Calculate the number of bucks\nnumber_of_bucks = (percent_bucks / 100) * total_deer\n\n# Calculate the number of 6 point bucks\nnumber_of_6_point_bucks = (percent_6_point_bucks / 100) * number_of_bucks\n\n# Output the result\nprint(number_of_6_point_bucks)\n```\n\nSUGGESTED NEXT SPEAKER: Agent Code Executor"
