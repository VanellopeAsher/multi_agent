      "content": "To solve this problem, our objective is to determine the total amount of protein John receives from consuming mushrooms weekly, given his daily intake.\n\nHere's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Find the Protein Content per Gram of Mushrooms**:\n   - Since 150 grams of mushrooms contain 4 grams of protein, we need to calculate how much protein is in one gram of mushrooms.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Protein per gram} = \\frac{4 \\text{ grams of protein}}{150 \\text{ grams of mushrooms}} = \\frac{4}{150} \\text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Daily Protein Intake**:\n   - John eats 300 grams of mushrooms each day, so let's find out how much protein he gets daily.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily protein intake} = 300 \\text{ grams} \\times \\frac{4}{150} = 8 \\text{ grams of protein}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Weekly Protein Intake**:\n   - Since John eats 300 grams of mushrooms every day for 7 days a week, his total weekly protein intake would be:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weekly protein intake} = 8 \\text{ grams/day} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 56 \\text{ grams of protein}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, John gets 56 grams of protein per week from eating 300 grams of mushrooms daily. \n\nNext, I will discuss this solution with my peers to ensure its accuracy and completeness."
