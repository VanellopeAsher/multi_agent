      "content": "To solve this problem, let's calculate the total amount of money that Kate can potentially earn from selling crayon muffins. Here is how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of Crayon Fragments:**\n   - Kate received 3 containers, each holding 64 crayons. \n   - Therefore, the total number of crayon fragments Kate has is: \n\n     \\[\n     64 \\text{ crayons/container} \\times 3 \\text{ containers} = 192 \\text{ crayon fragments}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Crayon Muffins Kate Can Make:**\n   - Each muffin requires 8 crayon fragments.\n   - So, the number of muffins Kate can make is calculated by dividing the total number of crayon fragments by the number of fragments needed per muffin:\n\n     \\[\n     \\frac{192 \\text{ crayon fragments}}{8 \\text{ fragments/muffin}} = 24 \\text{ muffins}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Compute the Total Money Earned from Selling the Muffins:**\n   - If each muffin sells for $1.50, then the total revenue from selling all the muffins is:\n\n     \\[\n     24 \\text{ muffins} \\times \\$1.50/\\text{muffin} = \\$36.00\n     \\]\n\nThus, Kate can earn a total of $36.00 by selling 24 crayon muffins."
