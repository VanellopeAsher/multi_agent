      "content": "To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to calculate the total time he spent on all activities and then determine what 40% of that total time is.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution\n\n1. **Boating Time**: John spent 60 hours boating.\n\n2. **Swimming Time**: John spent half the time swimming as he did boating.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Swimming Time} = \\frac{60}{2} = 30 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Watching Shows**: John watched 30 different shows, each 20 hours long.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Time Watching Shows} = 30 \\times 20 = 600 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Time Spent Calculation**: We know from the problem statement that watching shows constituted 30% of John's total time spent during vacation.\n\n   Let \\( T \\) be the total time John spent. Then:  \n   \\[\n   0.30T = 600\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( T \\), we get:  \n   \\[\n   T = \\frac{600}{0.30} = 2000 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Sightseeing Time Calculation**: We need to find 40% of the total time spent, which corresponds to the sightseeing time.  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Sightseeing Time} = 0.40 \\times 2000 = 800 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nSo, John spent 800 hours sightseeing during his vacation. \n\nLet's discuss this calculation to ensure we haven't missed anything or made any assumptions that need validation."
