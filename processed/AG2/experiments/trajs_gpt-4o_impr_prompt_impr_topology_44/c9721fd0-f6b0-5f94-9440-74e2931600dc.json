      "content": "To calculate the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing, we need to consider the following components:\n\n1. **Service Fee**: Patty's Plumbing charges a fixed service fee of $40 for every house call.\n\n2. **Labor Cost**: Labor is charged at $35 per hour. Since Patty's Plumbing charges for each hour or fraction of an hour as a full hour, we need to round up any partial hours worked. In this case, the job took 2.25 hours, which would be rounded up to 3 hours. Therefore, the labor cost is \\(3 \\text{ hours} \\times \\$35/\\text{hour} = \\$105\\).\n\n3. **Cost of Parts**: The cost of parts for the job is given as $60.\n\nTo find the total amount billed, we sum these three components:\n\n- Service Fee: $40\n- Labor Cost: $105\n- Cost of Parts: $60\n\nThus, the total amount billed by Patty's Plumbing is:\n\n\\[ \\$40 + \\$105 + \\$60 = \\$205 \\]\n\nLet's proceed to engage in discussion to confirm this solution."

Here's how you can structure that in Python code.\n\n```python\n# Import the math module to use the ceiling function\nimport math\n\n# Define the rates and costs\nservice_fee = 40  # Service fee for a house call\nhourly_rate = 35  # Charge per hour or fraction of an hour\nparts_cost = 60   # Cost of parts for the job\n\n# Time spent on the job\nhours_worked = 2.25\n\n# Calculate total labor cost: Round the hours up using the ceiling function\nlabor_hours = math.ceil(hours_worked)\nlabor_cost = labor_hours * hourly_rate\n\n# Calculate the total amount billed\ntotal_amount_billed = service_fee + labor_cost + parts_cost\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_amount_billed)\n```\n\nThis will accurately provide the total amount billed by Patty for the service.
