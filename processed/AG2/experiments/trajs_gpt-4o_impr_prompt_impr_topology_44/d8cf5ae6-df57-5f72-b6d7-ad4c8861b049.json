  "problem": "A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots, and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If the farmer needs to transport all the feed 2 trips, how many pounds can his farm truck carry at a time?",

      "content": "To determine how many pounds the farm truck can carry at a time, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the feed the farmer is buying and then figure out how much weight the truck must carry in each trip to transport all the feed in 2 trips.\n\n1. **Calculate the weight of each type of feed:**\n\n   - **Sugar Cubes**: \n     - 2 boxes × 1 pound = 2 pounds\n\n   - **Carrots**:\n     - 4 bags × 12 pounds = 48 pounds\n\n   - **Hay**: \n     - 42 bales × 75 pounds = 3,150 pounds\n\n   - **Oats**: \n     - 20 sacks × 65 pounds = 1,300 pounds\n\n2. **Calculate the total weight of all the feed:**\n\n   - Total weight = 2 pounds (sugar cubes) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 3,150 pounds (hay) + 1,300 pounds (oats)\n   - Total weight = 4,500 pounds\n\n3. **Determine the truck's carrying capacity per trip:**\n\n   - Since the farmer needs to transport all the feed in 2 trips, the truck must be able to carry half of the total weight in one trip.\n   - Weight per trip = Total weight / 2 trips = 4,500 pounds / 2\n   - Weight per trip = 2,250 pounds\n\nThus, the farm truck can carry 2,250 pounds at a time."
