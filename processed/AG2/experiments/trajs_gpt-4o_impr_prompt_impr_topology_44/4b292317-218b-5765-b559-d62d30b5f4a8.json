Length of each final cut:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{250}{50} = 5 \\text{ mm}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, each final cut will be 5 millimeters long.\n\nLet's discuss this result with the other agents to ensure accuracy and completeness."

This indicates that the calculation was either not appropriately handled in code, or there might have been an error in the output or translation of the result presented here.\n\n2. **Problem Solver Approach:** The calculation was carried out step by step:\n   - First, the initial cut length was correctly computed as \\( \\frac{10000}{40} = 250 \\) millimeters.\n   - Then each of these initial parts was divided into 50 further parts, resulting in each final cut being \\( \\frac{250}{50} = 5 \\) millimeters.\n\nConsidering both solutions, it is evident that the manually calculated solution provided by the Problem Solver is correct and aligns with the logical breakdown of the problem's steps.\n\n**Final Solution Declaration:**\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{5}**"
