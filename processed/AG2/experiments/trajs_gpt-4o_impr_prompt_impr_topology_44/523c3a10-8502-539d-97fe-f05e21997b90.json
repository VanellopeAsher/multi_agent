      "content": "To solve this problem, let's consider the number of s'mores required and how many s'mores one box of graham crackers can help in creating.\n\n1. **Determine the Total Number of S'mores Needed**:\n   - There are 9 children, each desiring 2 s'mores, resulting in a total of \\( 9 \\times 2 = 18 \\) s'mores for the children.\n   - There are 6 adults, each wanting 1 s'more, resulting in a total of \\( 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\) s'mores for the adults.\n   - Therefore, the total number of s'mores required is \\( 18 + 6 = 24 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of S'mores Supported by One Box of Graham Crackers**:\n   - Each packet of graham crackers is used for 8 s'mores.\n   - One box contains 3 packets, so one box can create \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\) s'mores.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Boxes Needed**:\n   - Since one box can create exactly 24 s'mores, which is the total amount needed, only 1 box of graham crackers is necessary.\n\nSo, one box of graham crackers should suffice to meet the needs of both the children and adults wanting s'mores."
