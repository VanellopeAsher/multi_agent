      "content": "Let's tackle this problem with a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Define the Variables**:  \n   - Let \\( S \\) be the amount of fence that Sam gets.\n   - Let \\( H \\) be the amount of fence that Harry gets.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations**:  \n   We have two key pieces of information:\n   - Sam and Harry together have a total of 200 feet of fence:  \n     \\[\n     S + H = 200\n     \\]\n   - Harry gets 80 feet more than Sam:  \n     \\[\n     H = S + 80\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitute and Solve**:  \n   Substitute the expression for \\( H \\) from the second equation into the first equation:  \n   \\[\n   S + (S + 80) = 200\n   \\]  \n   Simplify the equation:  \n   \\[\n   2S + 80 = 200\n   \\]  \n   Solve for \\( S \\) by first subtracting 80 from both sides:  \n   \\[\n   2S = 120\n   \\]  \n   Divide each side by 2:  \n   \\[\n   S = 60\n   \\]  \n\n4. **Calculate Harryâ€™s Amount**:  \n   Use the value of \\( S \\) to find \\( H \\):  \n   \\[\n   H = S + 80 = 60 + 80 = 140\n   \\]\n\n5. **Review the Solution**:  \n   Sam gets 60 feet of the fence, and Harry gets 140 feet. This checks out because their sum is 200 feet, which is the total amount of fence.\n\n6. **Result**:  \n   Sam is left with 60 feet of the fence.\n\nNow, I'll discuss this with the rest of the team to see if there are any additional insights or confirmations on the solution."
