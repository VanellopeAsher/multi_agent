Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and 350 apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and some apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many times did Joanne's sister gather as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees?",

      "content": "To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Joanne's contribution to apple gathering**:\n    - Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.\n    - Joanne gathers half this amount (i.e., 30 / 2 = 15 apples) from the shortest trees.\n    - Joanne gathers 350 apples from the average trees.\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of apples gathered by Joanne**:\n    - Total apples gathered by Joanne = 30 (tallest) + 15 (shortest) + 350 (average) = 395 apples.\n\n3. **Determine the number of apples gathered by Joanne's sister**:\n    - The sisters' combined total is 500 apples.\n    - So, the apples gathered by Joanne's sister = 500 - 395 = 105 apples.\n\n4. **Identify the contribution of Joanne's sister**:\n    - Joanne's sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees: 2 * 30 = 60 apples.\n    - She does not take any apples from the average trees.\n    - So, the remainder of her apples must come from the shortest trees.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of apples Joanne's sister gathers from the shortest trees**:\n    - Apples gathered from the shortest trees by Joanne's sister = 105 (total gathered by sister) - 60 (tallest trees) = 45 apples.\n\n6. **Determine how many times Joanne's sister gathers as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees**:\n    - Joanne gathered 15 apples from the shortest trees.\n    - Her sister gathered 45 apples from the shortest trees.\n    - Therefore, the sister gathered 45 / 15 = 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees as Joanne did.\n\nThus, Joanne's sister gathered 3 times as many apples as Joanne from the shortest trees."
