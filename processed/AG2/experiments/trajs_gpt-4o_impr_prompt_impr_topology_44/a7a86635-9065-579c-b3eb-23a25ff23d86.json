In one of the several activities they participated in, they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys and then went out for a scavenger hunt of seashells.

      "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of boys and girls involved in the activity and the total number of seashells collected by each group.\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Boys and Girls**:\n   - The problem states that there were 200 kids in total, divided into equal groups of boys and girls.\n   - Thus, there are 100 boys and 100 girls.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Seashells Brought by the Boys**:\n   - Each boy brought back 600 shells.\n   - Therefore, the total number of seashells collected by the boys is: \n     \\[\n     100 \\text{ boys} \\times 600 \\text{ shells/boy} = 60,000 \\text{ shells}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Seashells Brought by the Girls**:\n   - The problem states that the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys brought.\n   - The number of seashells brought by the boys is 60,000 shells. Therefore, the girls brought: \n     \\[\n     60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 60,000 + 240,000 = 300,000 \\text{ shells}.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Seashells Brought by Each Girl**:\n   - To find out how many seashells each girl brought, divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{300,000 \\text{ shells}}{100 \\text{ girls}} = 3,000 \\text{ shells/girl}.\n     \\]\n\nThus, each girl brought back 3,000 seashells."

The total number of kids is 200, with an equal number of boys and girls: 100 boys and 100 girls.\n2. Each boy collected 600 seashells, resulting in a total of \\(100 \\times 600 = 60,000\\) seashells for the boys.\n3. The girls collected seashells equal to what the boys collected (60,000), plus four times that amount, leading to \\(60,000 + 4 \\times 60,000 = 300,000\\) seashells.\n4. Dividing the total seashells collected by the girls by the number of girls, we get \\(300,000 \\div 100 = 3,000\\) seashells per girl.\n\nBoth agents independently verified this, and the problem statement has been strictly adhered to without assuming additional variables. The calculations are accurate, and I am confident in the solution.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{3000}**"
