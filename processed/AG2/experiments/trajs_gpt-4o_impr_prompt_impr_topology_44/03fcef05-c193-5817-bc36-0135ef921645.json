To account for this expense, subtract it from the total amount:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total after comic book} = 3200 - 500 = 2700\n   \\]\n\n5. **Money spent on a puzzle**: Raymond spends $1900 on a puzzle. Subtract this from the total remaining after the comic book:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total after puzzle} = 2700 - 1900 = 800\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Raymond has $800 left after all his transactions."
