Since Kyle took 6 fries, Billy takes \\( 2 \\times 6 = 12 \\) fries.\n    - Remaining fries: \\( 24 - 12 = 12 \\).\n\n4. **Colby's Action**: Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took. Since Kyle took 6 fries, Colby takes \\( 6 - 3 = 3 \\) fries.\n    - Remaining fries: \\( 12 - 3 = 9 \\).\n\n5. **Final Situation**: We know that after Ginger gives some fries to Griffin, he has 33 fries. Therefore, the fries Ginger gave Griffin is the difference between the fries he ended up with and the fries he had after everyone else took theirs:\n    - Fries Ginger gave Griffin: \\( 33 - 9 = 24 \\).\n\nTherefore, Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries."

Griffin initially has 30 fries.\n2. Kyle takes 6 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 fries.\n3. Billy then takes twice as many fries as Kyle, which is 12 fries, leaving Griffin with 12 fries.\n4. Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took, which is 3 fries, leaving Griffin with 9 fries.\n5. Griffin ends up with 33 fries after receiving some from Ginger.\n\nThe difference between the final number of fries (33) and the fries left after Colby's action (9) is the amount Ginger gave Griffin:\n\\[ 33 - 9 = 24 \\]\n\nTherefore, Ginger gave Griffin 24 fries.\n\n**SOLUTION_FOUND \\boxed{24}**"
