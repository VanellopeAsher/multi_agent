Here's a step-by-step outline of the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Dimensions of the Rectangle:**\n   - The long side of the rectangle measures 20.5 feet.\n   - The short side of the rectangle measures 15.5 feet.\n\n2. **Formula for the Perimeter of a Rectangle:**\n   The perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width})\n   \\]\n\n3. **Plug the Dimensions into the Formula:**\n   - Length = 20.5 feet\n   - Width = 15.5 feet\n\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (20.5 + 15.5)\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Calculations:**\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times 36 = 72 \\text{ feet} \n   \\]\n\nThus, the total length of the crepe-paper streamers that James needs to buy is 72 feet.\n\nNow, I will invite the other agents to discuss this solution and any additional insights they might have."
