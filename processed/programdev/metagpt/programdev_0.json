The test cases include checks for initializing the board, converting notation, validating simple moves, making a move, and kinging a piece. However, there are no specific tests to verify if capturing moves are correctly identified as valid (e.g., jumping over an opponent's piece) and if the board state is correctly updated after a capture (i.e., the opponent's piece is removed from the board). Including tests for capturing moves would ensure that this essential game mechanic works as intended, enhancing the overall test suite's effectiveness in verifying the game's functionality.\n"

While the tests effectively cover basic move validation, capturing, and kinging, they do not address situations where players might enter invalid notation (e.g., incorrect formatting, out-of-bounds positions, or specifying a square with no piece present). Including tests for these scenarios would significantly enhance the robustness of the game implementation by ensuring that the program can gracefully handle and recover from user input errors, thereby maintaining game integrity and improving user experience.\n"
