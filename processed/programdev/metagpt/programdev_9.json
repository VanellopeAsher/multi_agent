While `test_move_makes_changes()` checks if a move ('UP' in this case) results in a change to the grid, it does not ensure that moves in all directions are handled correctly and result in the expected grid transformations. This is important for thoroughly testing the game's core functionality, as the ability to move tiles in all directions and merge them appropriately is fundamental to the 2048 game's mechanics. Adding separate tests for each direction could help ensure that the game logic correctly interprets and executes moves in every possible direction.\n"

While there are tests to check the movement of tiles in all directions and the game's ability to determine if moves are possible, there is no explicit test to ensure that the score is correctly updated when tiles merge. This is a significant aspect of the game's functionality, as scoring is a key component that players use to track their progress and success.
