This scenario is important to test because it reflects real-world usage where users might accidentally press enter without typing an answer or input unexpected values. Ensuring the program can handle such cases gracefully, either by re-prompting the user for a valid answer or by providing a clear error message, is crucial for maintaining a smooth user experience. Adding a test case to cover this aspect would enhance the robustness of the test suite.\n"

      "content": "One critical observation regarding the test cases provided is the absence of tests specifically designed to evaluate the functionality of handling multiple-choice questions. The sample question bank and the tests focus solely on short-answer questions, where the user inputs a text response. However, the `TriviaQuiz` class is designed to accommodate questions with multiple-choice options (`'options'` key in the question dictionary), which introduces a different interaction pattern (selecting an option rather than typing an answer). Testing this aspect is crucial because it involves additional logic for displaying options and interpreting user input based on option numbers rather than text answers. Including tests that cover scenarios with multiple-choice questions would ensure that this feature works as intended and that the program can accurately process and score responses to these types of questions.\n"
