This means that, in its current form, the test cases as written cannot be executed directly against the `strands_puzzle` function without modifying the design of `strands_puzzle` to either expose these elements or refactor the puzzle into a class where methods and attributes can be accessed and tested individually.\n"

This direct manipulation bypasses the natural flow of the game (i.e., user input leading to changes in state) and does not test the integration of the puzzle's components (e.g., user input processing, validation of combinations, and the dynamic update of available strands). While direct state manipulation is useful for unit testing specific functionalities, it's also important to include tests that simulate the user's interaction with the puzzle to ensure that the puzzle behaves as expected when operated in a manner consistent with its intended use. This approach would provide a more comprehensive validation of the puzzle's functionality, including the correctness of user input handling and the overall game logic.\n"
