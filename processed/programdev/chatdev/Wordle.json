Feedback is provided for each guess, indicating correct letters in the correct position (green), correct letters in the wrong position (yellow), and incorrect letters (grey).\n\n## Quick Install\n\nNo external dependencies are required for this game. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.\n\n## 🤔 What is this?\n\nThis is a simple implementation of the popular Wordle game, designed to be played directly from the Linux Terminal. The game selects a random 5-letter word each day, and players have six attempts to guess it. Feedback is provided after each guess to help players deduce the correct word.\n\n## 📖 How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` script using Python in your terminal.\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Game Instructions**: Once the game starts, you will see a welcome message and instructions on how many attempts you have.\n\n3. **Make a Guess**: Enter a 5-letter word when prompted. Your input will be validated to ensure it is a valid 5-letter word.\n\n4. **Receive Feedback**: After each guess, you will receive feedback:\n   - `[green]` indicates a correct letter in the correct position.\n   - `[yellow]` indicates a correct letter in the wrong position.\n   - `[grey]` indicates an incorrect letter.\n\n5. **Win or Lose**: If you guess the word correctly within six attempts, you win! If not, the correct word will be revealed after all attempts are used.\n\n## Example Gameplay\n\n```plaintext\nWelcome to Wordle!\nYou have 6 attempts to guess the 5-letter word.\nAttempt 1: apple\nFeedback: [green][grey][grey][grey][grey]\nAttempt 2: grape\nFeedback: [grey][green][grey][grey][grey]\nAttempt 3: peach\nFeedback: [green][green][green][green][green]\nCongratulations! You've guessed the word!\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\n- **Daily Word**: The game selects a random word from a predefined list each time it is played. This list can be expanded or modified in the `get_daily_word` function within the `main.py` file.\n- **Customization**: Feel free to modify the word list or game rules to suit your preferences.\n\nEnjoy playing Wordle in your terminal!\n```"
