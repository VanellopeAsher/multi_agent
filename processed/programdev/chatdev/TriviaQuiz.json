However, there is a missing feature regarding the option to display correct answers after the quiz, which is part of the user's task. This feature needs to be implemented to fully comply with the user's requirements.\n\nTo address this, you can modify the `show_results` method in the `QuizApp` class to include an option to display the correct answers after the quiz is completed. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n1. Modify the `show_results` method to include a detailed result with correct answers:\n\n```python\ndef show_results(self):\n    result_text = f\"You scored {self.score} out of {len(self.questions)}\\n\\n\"\n    result_text += \"Correct Answers:\\n\"\n    for i, question in enumerate(self.questions):\n        correct_option = question.options[question.correct_answer_index]\n        result_text += f\"Q{i+1}: {question.text}\\nCorrect Answer: {correct_option}\\n\\n\"\n    messagebox.showinfo(\"Quiz Results\", result_text)\n    self.root.quit()\n```\n\nThis change will ensure that after the quiz, users can see which answers were correct, fulfilling the user's requirement for displaying correct answers after the quiz.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code. Format:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format."

However, one issue that needs to be addressed is the lack of configurability for the question bank. Currently, the questions are hardcoded within the `QuestionBank` class, which does not allow for easy configuration or expansion of the question set by the user. \n\nTo address this, I suggest implementing a mechanism to load questions from an external source, such as a JSON or CSV file. This will make the question bank configurable and allow users to easily modify or expand the set of questions without altering the code.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n\n1. **Modify `QuestionBank` to Load from a File:**\n   - Update the `QuestionBank` class to load questions from a JSON or CSV file. This file should contain the question text, options, and the index of the correct answer.\n\n2. **Example JSON Structure:**\n   ```json\n   [\n       {\n           \"text\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n           \"options\": [\"Paris\", \"London\", \"Berlin\", \"Madrid\"],\n           \"correct_answer_index\": 0\n       },\n       {\n           \"text\": \"What is 2 + 2?\",\n           \"options\": [\"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\"],\n           \"correct_answer_index\": 1\n       }\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Update `QuestionBank` Initialization:**\n   ```python\n   import json\n\n   class QuestionBank:\n       def __init__(self, file_path=\"questions.json\"):\n           self.questions = self.load_questions_from_file(file_path)\n\n       def load_questions_from_file(self, file_path):\n           with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n               data = json.load(file)\n               return [Question(q['text'], q['options'], q['correct_answer_index']) for q in data]\n   ```\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirement of having a configurable question bank, enhancing its usability and flexibility."

Rowling\", \"William Shakespeare\", \"Mark Twain\"], 2)\n        ]\n```\n\n\"\nComments on Codes:\n\"The code is mostly well-structured and adheres to the requirements. However, one issue that needs to be addressed is the lack of configurability for the question bank. Currently, the questions are hardcoded within the `QuestionBank` class, which does not allow for easy configuration or expansion of the question set by the user. \n\nTo address this, I suggest implementing a mechanism to load questions from an external source, such as a JSON or CSV file. This will make the question bank configurable and allow users to easily modify or expand the set of questions without altering the code.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n\n1. **Modify `QuestionBank` to Load from a File:**\n   - Update the `QuestionBank` class to load questions from a JSON or CSV file. This file should contain the question text, options, and the index of the correct answer.\n\n2. **Example JSON Structure:**\n   ```json\n   [\n       {\n           \"text\": \"What is the capital of France?\",\n           \"options\": [\"Paris\", \"London\", \"Berlin\", \"Madrid\"],\n           \"correct_answer_index\": 0\n       },\n       {\n           \"text\": \"What is 2 + 2?\",\n           \"options\": [\"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\"],\n           \"correct_answer_index\": 1\n       }\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Update `QuestionBank` Initialization:**\n   ```python\n   import json\n\n   class QuestionBank:\n       def __init__(self, file_path=\"questions.json\"):\n           self.questions = self.load_questions_from_file(file_path)\n\n       def load_questions_from_file(self, file_path):\n           with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n               data = json.load(file)\n               return [Question(q['text'], q['options'], q['correct_answer_index']) for q in data]\n   ```\n\nBy implementing these changes, the application will meet the requirement of having a configurable question bank, enhancing its usability and flexibility.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code. Format:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format."

However, if you plan to use any additional libraries or if there are any specific versions of Python you want to ensure compatibility with, you can specify them. Since the code does not explicitly use any external libraries that need to be installed via `pip`, the `requirements.txt` file will be minimal.\nHere is the `requirements.txt` file for the project:\n```\n# No external dependencies required for this project\n# Ensure Python 3.x is installed for tkinter support\n```\nIf you plan to extend the project with additional libraries in the future, you can update this file accordingly.
