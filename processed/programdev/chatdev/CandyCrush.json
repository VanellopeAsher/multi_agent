However, there is a critical issue regarding the handling of user interactions, specifically the swapping of candies. The `handle_events` method in `game.py` lacks the logic to detect and process user inputs for swapping candies, which is essential for the game to function as intended.\n\n### Comment with Highest Priority:\nThe `handle_events` method in `game.py` needs to be implemented to handle user inputs for swapping candies. This includes detecting mouse clicks or drags to select and swap adjacent candies on the game board.\n\n### Suggestions on Revision:\n1. **Implement User Interaction Logic:**\n   - Add logic to detect mouse clicks or drags to select two adjacent candies.\n   - Ensure that only valid swaps (adjacent candies) are processed.\n   - After a swap, check for matches and update the board accordingly.\n\n2. **Example Implementation:**\n   ```python\n   def handle_events(self):\n       for event in pygame.event.get():\n           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n               self.running = False\n           elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:\n               # Detect the first candy selected\n               self.first_selected = self.get_candy_at_mouse_position(event.pos)\n           elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP:\n               # Detect the second candy selected and attempt a swap\n               second_selected = self.get_candy_at_mouse_position(event.pos)\n               if self.first_selected and second_selected:\n                   if self.are_adjacent(self.first_selected, second_selected):\n                       self.board.swap_candies(self.first_selected, second_selected)\n                       self.board.update_board()\n                   self.first_selected = None\n\n   def get_candy_at_mouse_position(self, pos):\n       # Convert mouse position to board coordinates\n       x, y = pos\n       row = y // 75\n       col = x // 75\n       if 0 <= row < self.board.rows and 0 <= col < self.board.cols:\n           return (row, col)\n       return None\n\n   def are_adjacent(self, pos1, pos2):\n       # Check if two positions are adjacent on the board\n       r1, c1 = pos1\n       r2, c2 = pos2\n       return abs(r1 - r2) + abs(c1 - c2) == 1\n   ```\n\nBy implementing these changes, the game will be able to handle user interactions for swapping candies, which is crucial for the gameplay experience."

However, there is a critical issue regarding the handling of user interactions, specifically the swapping of candies. The `handle_events` method in `game.py` lacks the logic to detect and process user inputs for swapping candies, which is essential for the game to function as intended.\n\n### Comment with Highest Priority:\nThe `handle_events` method in `game.py` needs to be implemented to handle user inputs for swapping candies. This includes detecting mouse clicks or drags to select and swap adjacent candies on the game board.\n\n### Suggestions on Revision:\n1. **Implement User Interaction Logic:**\n   - Add logic to detect mouse clicks or drags to select two adjacent candies.\n   - Ensure that only valid swaps (adjacent candies) are processed.\n   - After a swap, check for matches and update the board accordingly.\n\n2. **Example Implementation:**\n   ```python\n   def handle_events(self):\n       for event in pygame.event.get():\n           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n               self.running = False\n           elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:\n               # Detect the first candy selected\n               self.first_selected = self.get_candy_at_mouse_position(event.pos)\n           elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP:\n               # Detect the second candy selected and attempt a swap\n               second_selected = self.get_candy_at_mouse_position(event.pos)\n               if self.first_selected and second_selected:\n                   if self.are_adjacent(self.first_selected, second_selected):\n                       self.board.swap_candies(self.first_selected, second_selected)\n                       self.board.update_board()\n                   self.first_selected = None\n\n   def get_candy_at_mouse_position(self, pos):\n       # Convert mouse position to board coordinates\n       x, y = pos\n       row = y // 75\n       col = x // 75\n       if 0 <= row < self.board.rows and 0 <= col < self.board.cols:\n           return (row, col)\n       return None\n\n   def are_adjacent(self, pos1, pos2):\n       # Check if two positions are adjacent on the board\n       r1, c1 = pos1\n       r2, c2 = pos2\n       return abs(r1 - r2) + abs(c1 - c2) == 1\n   ```\n\nBy implementing these changes, the game will be able to handle user interactions for swapping candies, which is crucial for the gameplay experience.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code. Format:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format."

The current implementation does not properly handle chain reactions where new candies form additional matches after the initial match is cleared. This is crucial for a match-3 game to ensure that the board updates correctly and all possible matches are cleared in a single move.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. **Enhance the `update_board` Method in `GameBoard`:**\n   - Ensure that after clearing matches and dropping candies, the board is checked again for new matches. This should continue until no new matches are found, effectively handling chain reactions.\n\n```python\ndef update_board(self, score_manager):\n    while True:\n        matches = self.find_matches()\n        if not matches:\n            break\n        self.clear_matches(matches, score_manager)\n        self.drop_candies()\n        self.refill_board()\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the board is continuously updated until no further matches are found, thereby correctly implementing chain reactions."

The current implementation does not properly handle chain reactions where new candies form additional matches after the initial match is cleared. This is crucial for a match-3 game to ensure that the board updates correctly and all possible matches are cleared in a single move.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n1. **Enhance the `update_board` Method in `GameBoard`:**\n   - Ensure that after clearing matches and dropping candies, the board is checked again for new matches. This should continue until no new matches are found, effectively handling chain reactions.\n\n```python\ndef update_board(self, score_manager):\n    while True:\n        matches = self.find_matches()\n        if not matches:\n            break\n        self.clear_matches(matches, score_manager)\n        self.drop_candies()\n        self.refill_board()\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the board is continuously updated until no further matches are found, thereby correctly implementing chain reactions.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code. Format:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format."
