`__init__`: Initializes the game board and sets the starting player.\n   - `drop_disc`: Handles the logic for placing a disc in a column.\n   - `check_winner`: Checks for a winning condition after each move.\n   - `is_draw`: Checks if the board is full and the game is a draw.\n   - `switch_player`: Switches the current player after a valid move.\n\n2. **ConnectFourGUI**: This class will handle the GUI components and user interactions.\n   - `__init__`: Sets up the GUI window and board display.\n   - `create_board`: Creates the visual representation of the board.\n   - `update_board`: Updates the board display after each move.\n   - `handle_click`: Handles user input when a column is clicked.\n   - `show_message`: Displays messages for win/draw conditions.\n\n### File Structure\n\n1. **main.py**: The main file to run the application.\n2. **connect_four_game.py**: Contains the game logic.\n3. **connect_four_gui.py**: Contains the GUI logic.\n\nLet's start with the implementation:\n\n#### main.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nMain file to run the Connect Four game application.\n\n'''\n\nfrom connect_four_gui import ConnectFourGUI\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app = ConnectFourGUI()\n    app.run()\n```\n\n#### connect_four_game.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nContains the game logic for Connect Four.\n\n'''\n\nclass ConnectFourGame:\n    ROWS = 6\n    COLUMNS = 7\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.board = [['' for _ in range(self.COLUMNS)] for _ in range(self.ROWS)]\n        self.current_player = 'Red'\n\n    def drop_disc(self, column):\n        for row in reversed(range(self.ROWS)):\n            if self.board[row][column] == '':\n                self.board[row][column] = self.current_player\n                return row, column\n        return None\n\n    def check_winner(self, row, column):\n        return (self.check_line(row, column, 1, 0) or  # Horizontal\n                self.check_line(row, column, 0, 1) or  # Vertical\n                self.check_line(row, column, 1, 1) or  # Diagonal /\n                self.check_line(row, column, 1, -1))   # Diagonal \\\n\n    def check_line(self, row, column, delta_row, delta_col):\n        count = 0\n        for d in range(-3, 4):\n            r = row + d * delta_row\n            c = column + d * delta_col\n            if 0 <= r < self.ROWS and 0 <= c < self.COLUMNS and self.board[r][c] == self.current_player:\n                count += 1\n                if count == 4:\n                    return True\n            else:\n                count = 0\n        return False\n\n    def is_draw(self):\n        return all(self.board[0][col] != '' for col in range(self.COLUMNS))\n\n    def switch_player(self):\n        self.current_player = 'Yellow' if self.current_player == 'Red' else 'Red'\n```\n\n#### connect_four_gui.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nContains the GUI logic for Connect Four using tkinter.\n\n'''\n\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import messagebox\nfrom connect_four_game import ConnectFourGame\n\nclass ConnectFourGUI:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.game = ConnectFourGame()\n        self.window = tk.Tk()\n        self.window.title(\"Connect Four\")\n        self.create_board()\n\n    def create_board(self):\n        self.buttons = []\n        for col in range(self.game.COLUMNS):\n            button = tk.Button(self.window, text=str(col+1), command=lambda c=col: self.handle_click(c))\n            button.grid(row=0, column=col)\n            self.buttons.append(button)\n\n        self.labels = [[None for _ in range(self.game.COLUMNS)] for _ in range(self.game.ROWS)]\n        for row in range(self.game.ROWS):\n            for col in range(self.game.COLUMNS):\n                label = tk.Label(self.window, text=' ', width=4, height=2, borderwidth=2, relief=\"groove\")\n                label.grid(row=row+1, column=col)\n                self.labels[row][col] = label\n\n    def update_board(self):\n        for row in range(self.game.ROWS):\n            for col in range(self.game.COLUMNS):\n                self.labels[row][col]['text'] = self.game.board[row][col]\n\n    def handle_click(self, column):\n        position = self.game.drop_disc(column)\n        if position:\n            row, col = position\n            self.update_board()\n            if self.game.check_winner(row, col):\n                self.show_message(f\"{self.game.current_player} wins!\")\n                self.window.quit()\n            elif self.game.is_draw():\n                self.show_message(\"It's a draw!\")\n                self.window.quit()\n            else:\n                self.game.switch_player()\n\n    def show_message(self, message):\n        messagebox.showinfo(\"Game Over\", message)\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.window.mainloop()\n```\n\nThis implementation provides a basic Connect Four game with a GUI using `tkinter`. The game logic is separated from the GUI logic, making it easier to maintain and extend.

This manual will guide you through the installation, setup, and gameplay of the Connect Four application developed using Python and Tkinter.\n\n## Introduction\n\nConnect Four is a classic two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.\n\n## Main Features\n\n- **Interactive Gameplay**: Two players can play against each other on the same device.\n- **Graphical User Interface**: The game features a simple and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter.\n- **Real-time Updates**: The board updates in real-time as players make their moves.\n- **Win and Draw Detection**: The game automatically detects and announces a win or a draw.\n- **Replay Option**: Players can choose to play again after a game ends.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n- **Tkinter**: Tkinter is included with standard Python installations, so no additional installation is required.\n\n### Installation Steps\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository.\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change to the project directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd <project-directory>\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the Game**: Execute the main script to start the game:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n## How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` script to launch the game window.\n\n2. **Choose a Column**: Players take turns clicking on the buttons at the top of each column to drop their discs. The current player is indicated by the color of the disc (Red or Yellow).\n\n3. **Objective**: The goal is to connect four of your discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n4. **Winning and Drawing**: The game will automatically detect and announce a winner when a player connects four discs. If the board fills up without a winner, the game will declare a draw.\n\n5. **Replay**: After a game ends, a prompt will appear asking if you want to play again. Choose 'Yes' to restart the game or 'No' to exit.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Tkinter Errors**: If you encounter issues related to Tkinter, ensure that your Python installation includes Tkinter. You may need to reinstall Python with Tkinter support.\n\n- **Python Errors**: Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Python (preferably Python 3.x).\n\n## Support\n\nFor further assistance, please contact our support team at support@chatdev.com.\n\nEnjoy playing Connect Four!"
