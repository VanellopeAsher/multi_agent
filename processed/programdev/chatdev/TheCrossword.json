The application will consist of several core components:\n\n1. **Main Application Class (`CrosswordApp`)**: This will initialize the GUI, handle user interactions, and manage the overall flow of the application.\n2. **Grid Class (`CrosswordGrid`)**: This will represent the crossword grid, manage the placement of words, and validate user input.\n3. **Clue Class (`Clue`)**: This will store information about each clue, including its position, direction, and answer.\n4. **Validation Function**: This will check if the user's input matches the correct answers and confirm completion.\n\nLet's start by laying out the necessary classes and functions:\n\n### Core Classes and Functions\n\n- **CrosswordApp**: Main application class.\n  - `__init__()`: Initialize the application and GUI components.\n  - `create_widgets()`: Create and place GUI widgets.\n  - `submit_word()`: Handle word submission by the user.\n  - `check_completion()`: Check if the crossword is completed correctly.\n\n- **CrosswordGrid**: Manage the crossword grid.\n  - `__init__()`: Initialize the grid with given dimensions.\n  - `place_word()`: Place a word in the grid.\n  - `validate_word()`: Validate if a word fits in the specified position.\n\n- **Clue**: Store clue information.\n  - `__init__()`: Initialize clue with position, direction, and answer.\n\n- **Helper Functions**:\n  - `load_clues()`: Load clues from a predefined list or file.\n  - `display_clues()`: Display clues in the GUI.\n\nNow, let's implement the code for each component.\n\n### Main Application File\n\n**main.py**\n\n```python\n'''\n\nMain application file for the crossword puzzle.

The `CrosswordApp` class manages the user interface and interactions, while the `CrosswordGrid` and `Clue` classes handle the grid and clues, respectively. The application can be extended with more features, such as loading clues from a file, adding more complex validation, and enhancing the GUI."
