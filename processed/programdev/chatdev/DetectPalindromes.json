The program will read a text file, process its contents, and identify palindromes. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the components we need:\n\n### Core Components\n\n1. **Main Application Class (`PalindromeApp`)**:\n   - Purpose: Initialize the GUI, handle user interactions, and display results.\n   - Methods:\n     - `__init__(self, master)`: Set up the GUI components.\n     - `load_file(self)`: Open a file dialog to select a text file.\n     - `detect_palindromes(self, text)`: Process the text to find palindromes.\n     - `display_results(self, palindromes)`: Show the detected palindromes in the GUI.\n\n2. **Utility Function (`is_palindrome`)**:\n   - Purpose: Check if a given word is a palindrome.\n   - Function:\n     - `is_palindrome(word)`: Return `True` if the word is a palindrome, `False` otherwise.\n\n### File Structure\n\n1. **main.py**: Contains the main application logic and GUI setup.\n2. **utils.py**: Contains utility functions like `is_palindrome`.\n\nLet's start with the implementation:\n\n#### main.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nMain application file for the Palindrome Detector with GUI using tkinter.\n\n'''\n\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom tkinter import filedialog, messagebox\nfrom utils import is_palindrome\n\nclass PalindromeApp:\n    def __init__(self, master):\n        self.master = master\n        master.title(\"Palindrome Detector\")\n\n        self.label = tk.Label(master, text=\"Select a text file to detect palindromes:\")\n        self.label.pack()\n\n        self.load_button = tk.Button(master, text=\"Load File\", command=self.load_file)\n        self.load_button.pack()\n\n        self.result_text = tk.Text(master, height=15, width=50)\n        self.result_text.pack()\n\n    def load_file(self):\n        file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(filetypes=[(\"Text files\", \"*.txt\")])\n        if file_path:\n            with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n                text = file.read()\n                palindromes = self.detect_palindromes(text)\n                self.display_results(palindromes)\n\n    def detect_palindromes(self, text):\n        words = text.split()\n        palindromes = [word for word in words if is_palindrome(word)]\n        return palindromes\n\n    def display_results(self, palindromes):\n        self.result_text.delete(1.0, tk.END)\n        if palindromes:\n            self.result_text.insert(tk.END, \"Palindromes found:\\n\")\n            for palindrome in palindromes:\n                self.result_text.insert(tk.END, f\"{palindrome}\\n\")\n        else:\n            self.result_text.insert(tk.END, \"No palindromes found.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    root = tk.Tk()\n    app = PalindromeApp(root)\n    root.mainloop()\n```\n\n#### utils.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nUtility functions for the Palindrome Detector application.\n\n'''\n\ndef is_palindrome(word):\n    '''\n\n    Check if a given word is a palindrome.\n\n    :param word: The word to check.\n    :return: True if the word is a palindrome, False otherwise.\n\n    '''\n    word = word.lower()\n    return word == word[::-1]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`main.py`**: This file sets up the GUI using `tkinter`. It allows the user to select a text file, processes the file to find palindromes, and displays the results in a text widget.\n- **`utils.py`**: Contains the `is_palindrome` function, which checks if a word is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.\n\nThis setup provides a simple yet functional application to detect palindromes in a text file using a user-friendly interface."

A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward, such as \"radar\" or \"level\". This application provides a user-friendly interface to load a text file and display any palindromes found within the file.\n\n## Quick Install\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nEnsure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Installation\n\n1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.\n\n2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code.\n\n3. Since there are no external dependencies required for this project, you can directly run the application without additional installations.\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. **Run the Application:**\n\n   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file, and execute the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Load a Text File:**\n\n   - Upon launching the application, you will see a window titled \"Palindrome Detector\".\n   - Click on the \"Load File\" button to open a file dialog.\n   - Select a text file (`*.txt`) from your system that you wish to analyze for palindromes.\n\n3. **View Results:**\n\n   - Once a file is loaded, the application will process the text and display any palindromes found in the text area below the \"Load File\" button.\n   - If no palindromes are found, the message \"No palindromes found.\" will be displayed.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Load File:** Allows users to select a text file from their system.\n- **Detect Palindromes:** Processes the text to identify and list palindromes.\n- **Display Results:** Shows the results in the application window.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor further details on the implementation, refer to the source code files:\n\n- `main.py`: Contains the main application logic and GUI setup.\n- `utils.py`: Includes utility functions such as `is_palindrome` to check if a word is a palindrome.\n\n## Support\n\nFor any issues or questions, please contact our support team or visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repo-link) for more information.\n\n---\n\nEnjoy using the Palindrome Detector to explore the fascinating world of palindromes in your text files!"
