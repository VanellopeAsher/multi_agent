`run()`: Starts the game loop.\n   - `handle_events()`: Processes user inputs.\n   - `update()`: Updates game state, including claw position and object interactions.\n   - `render()`: Draws the game elements on the screen.\n\n2. **Claw**: Represents the claw that moves back and forth.\n   - `move()`: Updates the claw's position.\n   - `grab()`: Attempts to grab an object.\n   - `reel_in()`: Reels in the grabbed object.\n\n3. **Object**: Represents objects that can be grabbed (e.g., gold, rocks).\n   - `__init__()`: Initializes object properties like position, value, and weight.\n   - `draw()`: Renders the object on the screen.\n\n4. **Level**: Manages the current level's state, including objects and difficulty.\n   - `load_objects()`: Loads objects for the level.\n   - `check_completion()`: Checks if the level's objectives are met.\n\n5. **Main**: Entry point to start the game.\n\n### File Structure\n\n1. `main.py`: Entry point of the application.\n2. `game.py`: Contains the Game class.\n3. `claw.py`: Contains the Claw class.\n4. `object.py`: Contains the Object class.\n5. `level.py`: Contains the Level class.\n\nLet's start with the implementation of each file.\n\n#### main.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nMain entry point for the Gold Miner game.\n\n'''\n\nimport pygame\nfrom game import Game\n\ndef main():\n    pygame.init()\n    game = Game()\n    game.run()\n    pygame.quit()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### game.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nManages the game loop, events, updates, and rendering for the Gold Miner game.\n\n'''\n\nimport pygame\nfrom claw import Claw\nfrom level import Level\n\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))\n        pygame.display.set_caption(\"Gold Miner\")\n        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()\n        self.running = True\n        self.claw = Claw()\n        self.level = Level()\n\n    def run(self):\n        while self.running:\n            self.handle_events()\n            self.update()\n            self.render()\n            self.clock.tick(60)\n\n    def handle_events(self):\n        for event in pygame.event.get():\n            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n                self.running = False\n            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n                if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:\n                    self.claw.grab(self.level.objects)\n\n    def update(self):\n        self.claw.move()\n        self.level.check_completion()\n\n    def render(self):\n        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))\n        self.claw.draw(self.screen)\n        self.level.draw(self.screen)\n        pygame.display.flip()\n```\n\n#### claw.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nRepresents the claw that moves and grabs objects in the Gold Miner game.\n\n'''\n\nimport pygame\n\nclass Claw:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.position = [400, 50]\n        self.direction = 1\n        self.grabbed_object = None\n\n    def move(self):\n        if self.grabbed_object is None:\n            self.position[0] += self.direction * 5\n            if self.position[0] <= 0 or self.position[0] >= 800:\n                self.direction *= -1\n\n    def grab(self, objects):\n        for obj in objects:\n            if obj.is_within_reach(self.position):\n                self.grabbed_object = obj\n                break\n\n    def reel_in(self):\n        if self.grabbed_object:\n            # Logic to reel in the object\n            pass\n\n    def draw(self, screen):\n        pygame.draw.line(screen, (255, 255, 255), (self.position[0], 0), self.position, 2)\n```\n\n#### object.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nRepresents objects that can be grabbed in the Gold Miner game.\n\n'''\n\nimport pygame\n\nclass Object:\n    def __init__(self, x, y, value, weight):\n        self.position = [x, y]\n        self.value = value\n        self.weight = weight\n\n    def is_within_reach(self, claw_position):\n        # Logic to determine if the object is within reach of the claw\n        return abs(claw_position[0] -

Ensure that objects are removed or marked as grabbed when the claw successfully reels them in.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\n# In level.py\ndef check_completion(self):\n    total_value = sum(obj.value for obj in self.objects if obj.grabbed)\n    if total_value >= self.minimum_gold_value or self.current_time >= self.time_limit:\n        self.end_level()\n\n# In object.py, add a grabbed attribute\nclass Object:\n    def __init__(self, x, y, value, weight):\n        self.position = [x, y]\n        self.value = value\n        self.weight = weight\n        self.grabbed = False  # Add this attribute\n\n# In claw.py, update the reel_in method to mark objects as grabbed\ndef reel_in(self):\n    if self.grabbed_object:\n        self.position[1] -= 5\n        if self.position[1] <= 50:\n            self.position[1] = 50\n            self.reeling = False\n            self.grabbed_object.grabbed = True  # Mark the object as grabbed\n            self.grabbed_object = None\n```\n\nThese changes will ensure that the game correctly tracks and sums the value of objects that have been successfully grabbed, aligning with the game's requirements.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code. Format:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format."

However, there is a critical issue regarding the time management for the level's completion. The `current_time` in the `Level` class is initialized but never updated, which means the time limit condition for ending the level will not function as intended.\n\n### Comment with Highest Priority:\nThe `current_time` variable in the `Level` class is not being updated, which means the game does not track the elapsed time, and the level will not end based on the time limit.\n\n### Suggestions on Revision:\n1. **Update Time in Game Loop:**\n   - In the `Game` class, update the `current_time` in the `Level` class within the `update()` method to track the elapsed time.\n   - Use `pygame.time.get_ticks()` to calculate the elapsed time since the start of the level.\n\n2. **Implement Time Update Logic:**\n   - Modify the `update()` method in `game.py` to include time tracking:\n     ```python\n     def update(self):\n         self.claw.move()\n         self.level.current_time += self.clock.get_time() / 1000  # Convert milliseconds to seconds\n         self.level.check_completion()\n     ```\n\nBy implementing these changes, the game will correctly track the elapsed time and end the level when the time limit is reached, fulfilling the user's requirement for time-based level completion.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code. Format:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format."

However, there is a significant issue regarding the logic of the game completion and difficulty progression, which is crucial for meeting the user's requirements of \"introducing ascending difficulty with more obstacles or tighter time limits.\"\n\n### Comment with Highest Priority:\nThe current implementation does not support multiple levels or increasing difficulty. The `Level` class only initializes a single level with a fixed set of objects and a static time limit. To meet the user's requirement for ascending difficulty, the game should support multiple levels with varying time limits, object values, and additional obstacles.\n\n### Suggestions on Revision:\n1. **Implement Multiple Levels:**\n   - Modify the `Level` class to accept parameters for different levels, such as `minimum_gold_value`, `time_limit`, and a list of objects.\n   - Create a method to load different levels with increasing difficulty, either by increasing the number of objects, decreasing the time limit, or introducing obstacles.\n\n2. **Level Progression Logic:**\n   - In the `Game` class, implement a mechanism to progress to the next level once the current level is completed. This could involve maintaining a list or queue of levels and loading the next one upon completion.\n\n3. **Dynamic Object Loading:**\n   - Enhance the `load_objects` method to load different sets of objects based on the current level. This could involve reading from a configuration file or generating objects programmatically.\n\n4. **Adjust Difficulty:**\n   - Introduce new types of objects or obstacles that affect the game, such as rocks that take longer to reel in or reduce the claw's speed.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the game will better align with the user's requirements for ascending difficulty and provide a more engaging experience."

This game challenges players to collect gold and other valuable objects using a claw that moves back and forth. The goal is to meet or exceed a minimum gold value before the time runs out, with increasing difficulty as you progress through levels.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Claw Movement**: The claw moves horizontally across the screen. Players must time their grabs to collect objects.\n- **Object Collection**: Each object has a value and weight. Successfully grabbing an object adds its value to your total.\n- **Level Progression**: Complete levels by meeting the minimum gold value within the time limit. Levels increase in difficulty with more obstacles and tighter time constraints.\n- **Real-time Updates**: The game displays the position of the claw and objects, updating after each grab.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nTo play the Gold Miner Game, you need to install the required dependencies. Follow these steps:\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the game files to your local machine.\n\n2. **Install Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n\n3. **Install Pygame**: The game uses the Pygame library for graphics and game mechanics. Install it using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pygame==2.1.2\n   ```\n\n## How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game**: Run the `main.py` file to start the game.\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Game Controls**:\n   - **Spacebar**: Press the spacebar to grab objects when the claw is in position.\n   - **Quit**: Close the game window or press the close button to exit.\n\n3. **Objective**: Collect enough gold to meet the level's minimum gold value before the time runs out. Use the claw to grab objects, and watch out for obstacles that increase in number and complexity as you advance.\n\n4. **Winning the Game**: Successfully complete all levels by meeting the gold requirements within the time limits to win the game.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information on the game's development and mechanics, refer to the source code files:\n\n- `main.py`: Entry point for the game.\n- `game.py`: Manages the game loop, events, updates, and rendering.\n- `claw.py`: Represents the claw mechanics.\n- `object.py`: Defines the objects that can be grabbed.\n- `level.py`: Manages the state and difficulty of each level.\n\nEnjoy playing the Gold Miner Game and challenge yourself to complete all levels!\n```"
