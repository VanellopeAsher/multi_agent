The current implementation does not include any mechanism to assign or display color-coded difficulty levels (yellow, green, blue, purple) for the categories when a correct group is identified.\n\nTo fix this, you should:\n\n1. Modify the `Puzzle` class to include a mapping of categories to their respective difficulty colors.\n2. Update the `check_group` method to return both the category and its associated color.\n3. Adjust the `select_word` method in `PuzzleGameApp` to display the color-coded feedback when a correct group is identified.\n\nHere's a suggestion for how you might implement these changes:\n\n```python\n# In puzzle.py, modify the Puzzle class to include difficulty colors\nclass Puzzle:\n    def __init__(self, words, categories, difficulty_colors):\n        '''\n        Initializes the Puzzle with words, categories, and difficulty colors.\n        '''\n        self.words = words\n        self.categories = categories\n        self.difficulty_colors = difficulty_colors\n        self.selected_words = []\n        self.correct_groups = []\n\n    def check_group(self, selected_words):\n        '''\n        Checks if the selected words form a correct group.\n        Returns the category and its color if correct, otherwise None.\n        '''\n        for category, words in self.categories.items():\n            if set(selected_words) == set(words):\n                return category, self.difficulty_colors[category]\n        return None, None\n\n# In daily_puzzle.py, update the puzzles to include difficulty colors\ndef load_puzzles(self):\n    return [\n        Puzzle(\n            [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\", \"dog\", \"cat\", \"fish\", \"bird\", \"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\", \"car\", \"bus\", \"bike\", \"train\"],\n            {\"fruits\": [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\"], \"animals\": [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"fish\", \"bird\"], \"colors\": [\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\", \"yellow\"], \"vehicles\": [\"car\", \"bus\", \"bike\", \"train\"]},\n            {\"fruits\": \"yellow\", \"animals\": \"green\", \"colors\": \"blue\", \"vehicles\": \"purple\"}\n        ),\n        # Add more puzzles as needed\n    ]\n\n# In main.py, update the select_word method to display color-coded feedback\ndef select_word(self, i, j):\n    # Logic for selecting a word and checking if a group is correct\n    word = self.puzzle.words[i*4+j]\n    if word not in self.selected_words:\n        self.selected_words.append(word)\n        self.buttons[i][j].config(state=\"disabled\")\n    if len(self.selected_words) == 4:\n        category, color = self.puzzle.check_group(self.selected_words)\n        if category:\n            self.feedback_label.config(text=f\"Correct!

Format:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format."

For example:\nrequirements.txt\n```\nnumpy==1.19.2\npandas>=1.1.4\n```\nAccording to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.\n\nProgrammer: Based on the provided code, the project primarily uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface, which is included with Python's standard library and does not need to be listed in `requirements.txt`. However, if there are any additional libraries or dependencies used in the project that are not part of the standard library, they should be included. Since the code does not explicitly mention any external libraries, the `requirements.txt` file will be minimal. Here is an example:\n```plaintext\n# requirements.txt\n# No external libraries are required for this project as it uses tkinter, which is part of the Python standard library.\n```\nIf you plan to extend the project with additional features that require external libraries, you would list those libraries and their versions in this file. For example, if you decide to use a library for advanced date handling or additional GUI components, you would add them here.
