This software allows you to generate Fibonacci numbers up to a specified number using a simple graphical user interface (GUI).\n\n## Main Functions\n\nThe Fibonacci Number Generator application provides the following main functions:\n\n- **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: Enter a non-negative integer, and the application will generate all Fibonacci numbers up to that number.\n- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application features an intuitive GUI that makes it easy to input numbers and view results.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nThis application is built using Python and requires no external dependencies. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the source code from the repository or copy the `main.py` file to your local machine.\n\n2. **Run the Application**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `main.py`, and execute the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n   This will launch the application window.\n\n## How to Use\n\n1. **Launch the Application**: Run the `main.py` file as described in the installation section.\n\n2. **Enter a Number**: In the application window, you will see a text entry field labeled \"Enter a number:\". Input a non-negative integer in this field.\n\n3. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: Click the \"Generate\" button. The application will calculate and display the Fibonacci numbers up to the entered number.\n\n4. **View Results**: The generated Fibonacci numbers will be displayed below the \"Generate\" button in the application window.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: If you enter a negative number or a non-integer value, an error message will be displayed. Please enter a valid non-negative integer to proceed.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Invalid Input**: Ensure that the input is a non-negative integer. The application will not accept negative numbers or non-integer values.\n- **Python Installation**: Verify that Python is correctly installed on your system by running `python --version` in your terminal or command prompt.\n\n## Support\n\nFor further assistance, please contact our support team or refer to the documentation provided in the application repository.\n\nThank you for using the Fibonacci Number Generator! We hope it meets your needs and enhances your experience with Fibonacci numbers."
