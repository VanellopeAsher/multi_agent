However, there is a potential issue with the logic in the `move` method of the `Game` class. Specifically, the condition `moved = moved or (row != merged)` and `moved = moved or (col != merged)` may not correctly detect if a move was made, as reversing the row or column can affect the comparison. This could lead to situations where a new tile is not added after a valid move.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n- Modify the logic to ensure that the `moved` variable accurately reflects whether any tiles were moved or merged. This can be done by comparing the grid before and after the move operation.\n\nHere's a suggested fix:\n\n```python\ndef move(self, direction):\n    if direction in ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']:\n        moved = False\n        original_grid = [row[:] for row in self.grid]  # Copy the grid\n        for i in range(4):\n            if direction in ['left', 'right']:\n                row = self.grid[i]\n                if direction == 'right':\n                    row.reverse()\n                merged, score = self.merge(row)\n                if direction == 'right':\n                    merged.reverse()\n                self.grid[i] = merged\n                self.score += score\n            else:\n                col = [self.grid[j][i] for j in range(4)]\n                if direction == 'down':\n                    col.reverse()\n                merged, score = self.merge(col)\n                if direction == 'down':\n                    merged.reverse()\n                for j in range(4):\n                    self.grid[j][i] = merged[j]\n                self.score += score\n        if self.grid != original_grid:  # Compare the grid before and after the move\n            moved = True\n        if moved:\n            self.add_new_tile()\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the `moved` variable accurately reflects whether the grid has changed, thus ensuring a new tile is added only when necessary."

However, there is a potential issue with the logic in the `move` method of the `Game` class. Specifically, the condition `moved = moved or (row != merged)` and `moved = moved or (col != merged)` may not correctly detect if a move was made, as reversing the row or column can affect the comparison. This could lead to situations where a new tile is not added after a valid move.\n\n### Suggested Revision:\n- Modify the logic to ensure that the `moved` variable accurately reflects whether any tiles were moved or merged. This can be done by comparing the grid before and after the move operation.\n\nHere's a suggested fix:\n\n```python\ndef move(self, direction):\n    if direction in ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']:\n        moved = False\n        original_grid = [row[:] for row in self.grid]  # Copy the grid\n        for i in range(4):\n            if direction in ['left', 'right']:\n                row = self.grid[i]\n                if direction == 'right':\n                    row.reverse()\n                merged, score = self.merge(row)\n                if direction == 'right':\n                    merged.reverse()\n                self.grid[i] = merged\n                self.score += score\n            else:\n                col = [self.grid[j][i] for j in range(4)]\n                if direction == 'down':\n                    col.reverse()\n                merged, score = self.merge(col)\n                if direction == 'down':\n                    merged.reverse()\n                for j in range(4):\n                    self.grid[j][i] = merged[j]\n                self.score += score\n        if self.grid != original_grid:  # Compare the grid before and after the move\n            moved = True\n        if moved:\n            self.add_new_tile()\n```\n\nThis change ensures that the `moved` variable accurately reflects whether the grid has changed, thus ensuring a new tile is added only when necessary.\"\nIn the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code. Format:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format."

However, there is a minor issue with the `merge` function in `game.py`. The function currently does not handle the case where multiple merges can occur in a single move correctly. For example, in a row like `[2, 2, 4, 4]`, the expected result after merging should be `[4, 8, 0, 0]`, but the current implementation would result in `[4, 4, 0, 0]`.\n\nTo fix this, you need to ensure that after a merge, the next tile is not immediately merged again in the same move.

Tiles with the same number merge into one, doubling the value. After each move, a new tile appears in a random empty cell. The game ends when no moves are possible. The game tracks and displays the current score and the highest tile reached.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nTo get started with the 2048 game, you need to install the required dependencies. The game is built using Python and Pygame, so make sure you have Python installed on your system.\n\n1. **Install Pygame**: You can install Pygame using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install pygame==2.1.2\n    ```\n\n2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the game code to your local machine.\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone <repository-url>\n    ```\n\n3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your directory to the project folder.\n\n    ```bash\n    cd <project-directory>\n    ```\n\n## 🤔 What is this?\n\nThe 2048 game is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game. The objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is simple yet challenging, requiring strategic thinking and planning.\n\n## 📖 How to Play\n\n1. **Start the Game**: Run the main Python script to start the game.\n\n    ```bash\n    python main.py\n    ```\n\n2. **Game Controls**: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tiles in the desired direction:\n   - **Up Arrow**: Move tiles up.\n   - **Down Arrow**: Move tiles down.\n   - **Left Arrow**: Move tiles left.\n   - **Right Arrow**: Move tiles right.\n\n3. **Objective**: Combine tiles with the same number to double their value. Try to reach the 2048 tile!\n\n4. **Game Over**: The game ends when no more moves are possible. Your score and the highest tile reached will be displayed.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Grid Management**: The game uses a 4x4 grid to manage tiles.\n- **Tile Merging**: Tiles with the same number merge into one, doubling the value.\n- **Random Tile Generation**: After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears in a random empty cell.\n- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks and displays the current score.\n- **Highest Tile Tracking**: The game displays the highest tile reached during the session.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more detailed information on the game's implementation and code structure, please refer to the source code files:\n\n- **main.py**: The main entry point for the game application.\n- **game.py**: Contains the game logic, including state management and tile operations.\n- **gui.py**: Handles the graphical user interface using Pygame.\n\nEnjoy playing the 2048 game and challenge yourself to reach the highest tile possible!\n```"
