Here's how you can adjust the code:\n\n1. Add an attribute to keep track of the current combination of strands.\n2. Update the `check_merge` method to append the selected strand to the current combination and check if this new combination is valid.\n3. Provide feedback based on the validity of the current combination.\n\nHere's a suggested modification:\n\n```python\nclass StrandsGame:\n    def __init__(self, master):\n        self.master = master\n        self.master.title(\"Strands Game\")\n        # Initialize game components\n        self.strands = [Strand(\"he\"), Strand(\"llo\"), Strand(\"wor\"), Strand(\"ld\")]\n        self.validator = WordValidator([\"hello\", \"world\", \"helloworld\"])\n        self.current_combination = \"\"\n        # Create GUI components\n        self.create_widgets()\n\n    def create_widgets(self):\n        self.strand_buttons = []\n        for strand in self.strands:\n            button = tk.Button(self.master, text=strand.get_text(), command=lambda s=strand: self.check_merge(s))\n            button.pack(side=tk.LEFT)\n            self.strand_buttons.append(button)\n        self.feedback_label = tk.Label(self.master, text=\"Combine strands to form words!\")\n        self.feedback_label.pack()\n        self.reset_button = tk.Button(self.master, text=\"Reset\", command=self.reset_game)\n        self.reset_button.pack()\n\n    def check_merge(self, strand):\n        # Append the selected strand to the current combination\n        self.current_combination += strand.get_text()\n        # Check if the current combination is valid\n        if self.validator.is_valid(self.current_combination):\n            self.update_feedback(\"Valid merge!\")\n        else:\n            self.update_feedback(\"Invalid merge, try again.\")\n\n    def update_feedback(self, message):\n        self.feedback_label.config(text=message)\n\n    def reset_game(self):\n        self.current_combination = \"\"\n        self.update_feedback(\"Combine strands to form words!\")\n```\n\nThis modification allows the player to incrementally merge strands and receive feedback on each step, aligning with the task requirements."

It currently checks the validity of the combination of all strands at once, rather than allowing the player to merge strands incrementally. This does not align with the task requirement of providing feedback on valid merges as the player combines strands. \n\nTo fix this, you should modify the `check_merge` method to keep track of the current combination of strands and validate each incremental merge. Here's how you can adjust the code:\n\n1. Add an attribute to keep track of the current combination of strands.\n2. Update the `check_merge` method to append the selected strand to the current combination and check if this new combination is valid.\n3.
