Below is the plan for the core classes and functions needed for the game:\n\n### Core Classes and Functions\n\n1. **Game**: \n   - Purpose: Manages the game loop, event handling, and game state.\n   - Methods:\n     - `run()`: Main game loop.\n     - `handle_events()`: Handles user input and game events.\n     - `update()`: Updates game state.\n     - `draw()`: Renders the game objects.\n\n2. **Paddle**:\n   - Purpose: Represents the player's paddle.\n   - Methods:\n     - `move_up()`: Moves the paddle up.\n     - `move_down()`: Moves the paddle down.\n     - `draw()`: Draws the paddle on the screen.\n\n3. **Ball**:\n   - Purpose: Represents the ball in the game.\n   - Methods:\n     - `move()`: Updates the ball's position.\n     - `check_collision()`: Checks for collisions with paddles and walls.\n     - `draw()`: Draws the ball on the screen.\n\n4. **Scoreboard**:\n   - Purpose: Keeps track of the players' scores.\n   - Methods:\n     - `update_score()`: Updates the score when a player scores a point.\n     - `draw()`: Displays the current score on the screen.\n\n5. **Constants**:\n   - Purpose: Stores game constants like screen dimensions, colors, paddle speed, etc.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement the code in multiple files:\n\n#### main.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nMain file to run the Pong game.\n\n'''\n\nimport pygame\nfrom game import Game\n\ndef main():\n    pygame.init()\n    game = Game()\n    game.run()\n    pygame.quit()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n#### game.py\n\n```python\n'''\n\nGame class to manage the game loop and state.\n\n'''\n\nimport pygame\nfrom paddle import Paddle\nfrom ball import Ball\nfrom scoreboard import Scoreboard\nfrom constants import *\n\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT))\n        pygame.display.set_caption(\"Pong Game\")\n        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()\n        self.paddle1 = Paddle(10, SCREEN_HEIGHT // 2 -

Each player controls a vertical paddle to bounce a ball back and forth. The game includes scoring and a winning threshold.\n\n## Quick Install\n\nTo run the Pong game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the required dependencies using the following command:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## 🎮 What is this?\n\nThe Pong game is a simple yet engaging two-player game where each player controls a paddle to bounce a ball back and forth. The objective is to score points by making the opponent miss the ball. The game ends when a player reaches the winning score threshold.\n\n### Main Features\n\n- **Two-Player Mode**: Each player controls a paddle using keyboard keys.\n- **Ball Mechanics**: The ball bounces off the paddles and the top and bottom edges of the screen.\n- **Scoring System**: Players score a point when the opponent misses the ball.\n- **Winning Threshold**: The game ends when a player reaches the predefined winning score.\n- **Automatic Ball Reset**: The ball resets to the center after each point is scored.\n\n## 📖 How to Play\n\n### Controls\n\n- **Player 1**: Use the `W` key to move the paddle up and the `S` key to move it down.\n- **Player 2**: Use the `UP ARROW` key to move the paddle up and the `DOWN ARROW` key to move it down.\n\n### Objective\n\n- Bounce the ball back to the opponent using your paddle.\n- Score points by making the opponent miss the ball.\n- The first player to reach the winning score wins the game.\n\n## 🚀 Running the Game\n\n1. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.\n2. Clone the repository or download the source code.\n3. Navigate to the directory containing the game files.\n4. Install the required dependencies using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n5. Run the game using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n6. Enjoy the game!\n\n## 🛠️ Customization\n\nYou can customize various aspects of the game by modifying the `constants.py` file:\n\n- **Screen Dimensions**: Adjust `SCREEN_WIDTH` and `SCREEN_HEIGHT` for different screen sizes.\n- **Paddle Settings**: Modify `PADDLE_WIDTH`, `PADDLE_HEIGHT`, and `PADDLE_SPEED` to change paddle dimensions and speed.\n- **Ball Settings**: Change `BALL_SIZE` and `BALL_SPEED` to adjust ball size and speed.\n- **Winning Score**: Set `WINNING_SCORE` to define the number of points needed to win the game.\n\n## 📚 Documentation\n\nFor further details on the code structure and implementation, refer to the source code files:\n\n- `main.py`: Initializes and runs the game.\n- `game.py`: Manages the game loop and state.\n- `paddle.py`: Defines the paddle behavior and rendering.\n- `ball.py`: Handles ball movement, collision, and scoring.\n- `scoreboard.py`: Manages the scoring system and displays scores.\n- `constants.py`: Contains all configurable constants for the game.\n\nEnjoy playing the classic Pong game and feel free to modify it to suit your preferences!\n```"
