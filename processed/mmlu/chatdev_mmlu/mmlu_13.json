The uncertainty in the ball's mass is negligible.\n\n2. **Physics Concept**: The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n   \\]\n   where \\( m \\) is the mass and \\( v \\) is the speed of the object. The uncertainty in kinetic energy is related to the uncertainty in speed.\n\n3. **Uncertainty Calculation**: The percentage uncertainty in a quantity that is squared (like speed in the kinetic energy formula) is twice the percentage uncertainty in the original quantity. Therefore, if the uncertainty in speed is 10%, the uncertainty in kinetic energy will be:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times 10\\% = 20\\%\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above calculation, the uncertainty in the kinetic energy of the ball is 20%.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n```\nThe answer is (3)\n```"

This software is designed to help users calculate the uncertainty in kinetic energy based on the uncertainty in speed. This manual will guide you through the installation, setup, and usage of the software.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Physics Uncertainty Calculator is a simple tool that allows users to input the percentage uncertainty in speed and receive the corresponding percentage uncertainty in kinetic energy. This is particularly useful for physics students and educators who need to perform quick calculations related to experimental uncertainties.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Calculate Kinetic Energy Uncertainty:** The software calculates the uncertainty in kinetic energy based on the inputted uncertainty in speed. Since kinetic energy is proportional to the square of speed, the uncertainty in kinetic energy is twice the uncertainty in speed.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use the Physics Uncertainty Calculator, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you need to install the required dependencies.\n\n### Step 1: Install Python\n\nEnsure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n### Step 2: Install Dependencies\n\nThe software requires the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. This library is included with most Python installations. However, if you encounter any issues, you can install it using the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install python3-tk\n```\n\n### Step 3: Download the Software\n\nClone the repository or download the source code files (`main.py` and `physics_calculator.py`) to your local machine.\n\n### Step 4: Run the Software\n\nNavigate to the directory containing the downloaded files and run the following command to start the application:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. **Launch the Application:** Run `main.py` to open the Physics Uncertainty Calculator GUI.\n\n2. **Enter Speed Uncertainty:** In the input field, enter the percentage uncertainty of the speed. Ensure that the value is a positive number.\n\n3. **Calculate:** Click the \"Calculate\" button. The software will compute the kinetic energy uncertainty and display the result.\n\n4. **View Result:** The calculated kinetic energy uncertainty will be displayed below the input field.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **Invalid Input:** If you enter a negative value or a non-numeric input, an error message will be displayed. Please enter a valid positive number.\n\n- **Display Issues:** If you encounter issues with the graphical display, ensure that your environment supports `tkinter`.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Physics Uncertainty Calculator is a straightforward tool for calculating uncertainties in physics experiments. By following this manual, you should be able to install, set up, and use the software effectively. If you have any further questions or require support, please contact our support team.\n\nThank you for using the Physics Uncertainty Calculator!"

This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which tells GUI applications where to render their windows, is not set.\n\n2. **Possible Solutions**:\n   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical display environment.\n   - **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the application on a server, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment.\n   - **Modify the Application**: If a GUI is not necessary, consider modifying the application to run in a command-line environment without using Tkinter.\n\nIn summary, the issue is not with the code itself but with the environment in which it is being executed. Adjusting the environment to support GUI operations or modifying the application to run without a GUI are the primary solutions."

However, if you want to ensure that the project specifies a Python version, you can include that information.\nHere is the `requirements.txt` file:\n```\n# No external dependencies are required for this project.\n# Ensure Python 3.x is installed for tkinter support.\n```\nIf you want to specify a Python version, you can add:\n```\npython_version >= \"3.6\"\n```\nThis ensures that the project is run with a compatible version of Python that supports `tkinter`. According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.\""
