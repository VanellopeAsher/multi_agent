Therefore, there are no external dependencies that need to be specified in the `requirements.txt` file for this project.\n\nHowever, if you plan to expand the project in the future or if there are any additional packages you might use, you can include them in the `requirements.txt` file. For now, since there are no additional dependencies, the `requirements.txt` file will be empty:\n\n```\n# requirements.txt\n\n# No external dependencies required for this project.\n```\n\nIf you decide to add any additional libraries or dependencies in the future, you can update the `requirements.txt` file accordingly."

The options provided are:\n   - 0: a positional dispute.\n   - 1: a territorial dispute.\n   - 2: a resource dispute.\n   - 3: a functional dispute.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **Positional Dispute**: This typically involves disagreements over the location of a boundary or the position of a geographical feature.\n   - **Territorial Dispute**: This involves a disagreement over the ownership or control of land between two or more states or over the possession of a region.\n   - **Resource Dispute**: This involves conflicts over the control of resources such as minerals, water, or oil.\n   - **Functional Dispute**: This involves disagreements over the policies or functions of a region or area.\n\n3. **Contextual Understanding**: The Spratley Islands dispute is widely recognized as a territorial dispute. Multiple countries, including China and Vietnam, claim sovereignty over these islands, which are strategically located and potentially rich in resources.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is that the dispute is a territorial dispute.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nThe answer is (1)."
