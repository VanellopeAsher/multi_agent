When running the script in an environment without a GUI (like a headless server or a remote terminal without X11 forwarding), the display environment variable `$DISPLAY` is not set, leading to this error.\n\n### Potential Solutions:\n1. **Run Locally on a GUI-Enabled System**: \n   - Ensure that the script is executed on a machine with a graphical desktop environment where Tkinter can create and manage windows.\n\n2. **Use X11 Forwarding**:\n   - If you are connecting to a remote server via SSH, use X11 forwarding to enable GUI applications to run. You can do this by using the `-X` or `-Y` option with the `ssh` command:\n     ```bash\n     ssh -X user@remote-server\n     ```\n   - Ensure that the X11 server is running on your local machine.\n\n3. **Virtual Display (Xvfb)**:\n   - For environments where a GUI is not available, you can use a virtual framebuffer like Xvfb to simulate a display:\n     ```bash\n     Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &\n     export DISPLAY=:99\n     python main.py\n     ```\n   - This will create a virtual display that Tkinter can use to render the GUI components.\n\nBy addressing the environment where the script is executed, you can resolve the `TclError` and successfully run the Tkinter application."

When running the script in an environment without a GUI (like a headless server or a remote terminal without X11 forwarding), the display environment variable `$DISPLAY` is not set, leading to this error.\n\n### Potential Solutions:\n1. **Run Locally on a GUI-Enabled System**: \n   - Ensure that the script is executed on a machine with a graphical desktop environment where Tkinter can create and manage windows.\n\n2. **Use X11 Forwarding**:\n   - If you are connecting to a remote server via SSH, use X11 forwarding to enable GUI applications to run. You can do this by using the `-X` or `-Y` option with the `ssh` command:\n     ```bash\n     ssh -X user@remote-server\n     ```\n   - Ensure that the X11 server is running on your local machine.\n\n3. **Virtual Display (Xvfb)**:\n   - For environments where a GUI is not available, you can use a virtual framebuffer like Xvfb to simulate a display:\n     ```bash\n     Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &\n     export DISPLAY=:99\n     python main.py\n     ```\n   - This will create a virtual display that Tkinter can use to render the GUI components.\n\nBy addressing the environment where the script is executed, you can resolve the `TclError` and successfully run the Tkinter application.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary.

Let's analyze the options step by step:\n\n1. **Strength**: While strength is important for overall fitness, it is not the primary attribute for marathon running, which requires sustained effort over a long period.\n\n2. **Power**: Power is more relevant to short bursts of energy, such as in sprinting, rather than the endurance needed for a marathon.\n\n3. **Stride Length**: While stride length can contribute to running efficiency, it is not the key attribute for marathon success.\n\n4. **Stamina**: Stamina refers to the ability to sustain prolonged physical or mental effort, which is crucial for marathon running, as it involves maintaining a steady pace over a long distance.\n\nGiven this analysis, the key attribute for successful marathon running is stamina.\n\nThe answer is (3)."

This issue typically arises when trying to run a Tkinter application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display, such as a headless server or a remote machine without a GUI.\n\nHere are the key points to address the issue:\n\n1. **Headless Environment**: The error suggests that the script is being executed in a headless environment where there is no graphical display available. This is common in environments like remote servers or Docker containers without a GUI.\n\n2. **DISPLAY Environment Variable**: The script attempts to set the `DISPLAY` environment variable to `\":0\"` if it is not already set. However, simply setting this variable does not create a display; it only points to an existing one. If there is no display server running, this will not resolve the issue.\n\n3. **Solution**:\n   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical interface.\n   - **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the application in a headless environment, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer). This can simulate a display for applications that require one.\n   - **SSH with X11 Forwarding**: If you are accessing a remote machine via SSH, ensure that X11 forwarding is enabled. This allows GUI applications to be displayed on your local machine.\n\nTo summarize, the issue is due to the lack of a graphical display in the environment where the script is being executed. The solution involves either running the application in an environment with a display or using tools to simulate a display."

This is indicated by the error message: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'Xvfb'`.\n\n3. **Cause**: \n   - The application attempts to use `Xvfb` to run the GUI in a headless environment (an environment without a graphical display).

The specific error is a `FileNotFoundError`, which occurs because the program is trying to use `Xvfb` (X virtual framebuffer) to create a virtual display, but `Xvfb` is not installed on the system.\n\nHere is a summary of the issue:\n\n1. **Error Location**: The error occurs in the `main.py` file, specifically when the program tries to create a `Display` object using the `pyvirtualdisplay` library.\n\n2. **Error Details**: \n   - The error traceback shows that the `FileNotFoundError` is raised because the `Xvfb` executable is not found on the system. This is indicated by the error message: `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'Xvfb'`.\n\n3. **Cause**: \n   - The application attempts to use `Xvfb` to run the GUI in a headless environment (an environment without a graphical display). However, `Xvfb` is not installed on the system, which leads to the `FileNotFoundError`.\n\n4. **Solution**: \n   - To resolve this issue, you need to install `Xvfb` on your system. This can typically be done using a package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it using the command: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`.\n\nBy installing `Xvfb`, the application should be able to run in a headless environment without encountering this error.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary.

However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.\n\nThis library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:\n\n**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**\n\n- Documentation\n\n- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\n\n**🤖 Agents**\n\n- Documentation\n\n- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\n\n## 📖 Documentation\n\nPlease see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:\n\n- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)\n\n- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)\n\n- Reference (full API docs)\n\n- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)\n\n```"

This software is designed to help users test their knowledge on clinical topics through a multiple-choice question interface. Below is a detailed guide on how to install, set up, and use the application.\n\n## Main Functions\n\nThe Clinical Knowledge Quiz application provides the following main functions:\n\n- **Interactive Quiz Interface**: Users can engage with multiple-choice questions through a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.\n- **Immediate Feedback**: After selecting an answer, users receive instant feedback on whether their choice was correct or incorrect.\n- **Educational Tool**: Designed to enhance learning and retention of clinical knowledge through active participation.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore installing the application, ensure you have the following:\n\n- **Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n- **Tkinter**: This is a standard GUI toolkit for Python. It is usually included with Python installations, but if not, you can install it via your package manager.\n- **Optional**: If you plan to run the application in a headless environment (e.g., a server without a display), you will need `pyvirtualdisplay`.\n\n### Quick Install\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the code from the repository or copy the provided code files (`main.py` and `question.py`) into a directory on your system.\n\n2. **Install Dependencies**: \n   - If you are running the application in a headless environment, install `pyvirtualdisplay` using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install pyvirtualdisplay\n     ```\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Running the Application\n\n1. **Start the Application**: Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Interacting with the Quiz**:\n   - A window titled \"Clinical Knowledge Quiz\" will appear.\n   - Read the question displayed at the top of the window.\n   - Select your answer by clicking on one of the radio buttons corresponding to the options provided.\n   - Click the \"Submit\" button to check your answer.\n\n3. **Receiving Feedback**:\n   - A message box will appear indicating whether your answer was correct or incorrect.\n   - The correct answer will be displayed in the message box for your reference.\n\n### Headless Environment\n\nIf you are running the application on a server or a system without a display, ensure `pyvirtualdisplay` is installed and configured as described in the installation section. The application will attempt to use a virtual display to render the GUI.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Clinical Knowledge Quiz application is a simple yet effective tool for testing and improving your clinical knowledge. By following the instructions in this manual, you should be able to set up and use the application with ease. Enjoy learning and testing your knowledge!"
