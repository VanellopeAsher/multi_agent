The specific error message is:\n\n```\n_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable\n```\n\nThis error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter application on a system that does not have access to a graphical display environment. This is common when running the code on a remote server or in an environment without a graphical user interface, such as a headless server or a Docker container without GUI support.\n\nHere are the key points to address this issue:\n\n1. **Graphical Environment**: Ensure that the environment where you are running the script has access to a graphical display. If you are working on a remote server, you might need to use a tool like X11 forwarding (e.g., using `ssh -X`) to enable GUI applications to display on your local machine.\n\n2. **Environment Variables**: The `$DISPLAY` environment variable is not set, which is necessary for GUI applications to know where to render the display. You can set this variable manually if you have access to a display server.\n\n3. **Headless Execution**: If you are running this script in an environment where a GUI is not possible or not needed, consider using a different approach to test the logic, such as running the application in a local environment with GUI support or using a headless testing framework.\n\nIn summary, the issue is not with the code itself but with the execution environment lacking GUI support. To resolve this, you need to ensure that the environment supports GUI applications or adjust your setup to allow GUI rendering."

The specific error message is:\n\n```\n_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable\n```\n\nThis error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter application on a system that does not have access to a graphical display environment. This is common when running the code on a remote server or in an environment without a graphical user interface, such as a headless server or a Docker container without GUI support.\n\nHere are the key points to address this issue:\n\n1. **Graphical Environment**: Ensure that the environment where you are running the script has access to a graphical display. If you are working on a remote server, you might need to use a tool like X11 forwarding (e.g., using `ssh -X`) to enable GUI applications to display on your local machine.\n\n2. **Environment Variables**: The `$DISPLAY` environment variable is not set, which is necessary for GUI applications to know where to render the display. You can set this variable manually if you have access to a display server.\n\n3. **Headless Execution**: If you are running this script in an environment where a GUI is not possible or not needed, consider using a different approach to test the logic, such as running the application in a local environment with GUI support or using a headless testing framework.\n\nIn summary, the issue is not with the code itself but with the execution environment lacking GUI support. To resolve this, you need to ensure that the environment supports GUI applications or adjust your setup to allow GUI rendering.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary.

Ensure you have a graphical environment available.\")\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe code has been modified to handle the `TclError` gracefully by wrapping the `root.mainloop()` call in a `try-except` block. This will catch the error if the GUI cannot be started due to the lack of a display environment, and it will print an error message instead of crashing. This approach allows the code to be more robust when executed in environments without GUI support."

This allows GUI applications to run in environments without a physical display.\n\n- **Modify the Application**: If running a GUI is not essential, consider modifying the application to work in a command-line interface (CLI) mode, which does not require a graphical display.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the `TclError`."

The specific error is:\n\n```\n_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable\n```\n\nThis error typically occurs when you attempt to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display. This is common in headless environments, such as remote servers or environments without a graphical user interface.\n\nHere is a summary of the issue and potential solutions:\n\n1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the script is being executed in an environment where there is no display server available. Tkinter requires a display server to render the GUI components.\n\n2. **Headless Environment**: If you are running this script on a server or a system without a graphical interface (headless), you will need to either:\n   - Run the script on a machine with a graphical interface.\n   - Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment.\n\n3. **Solution with Xvfb**:\n   - Install Xvfb on your system if it is not already installed.\n   - Run your script with Xvfb to provide a virtual display. You can do this by prefixing your command with `xvfb-run`, like so:\n     ```bash\n     xvfb-run python main.py\n     ```\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the display-related error."

Tkinter requires a display server to render the GUI components.\n\n2. **Headless Environment**: If you are running this script on a server or a system without a graphical interface (headless), you will need to either:\n   - Run the script on a machine with a graphical interface.\n   - Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment.\n\n3. **Solution with Xvfb**:\n   - Install Xvfb on your system if it is not already installed.\n   - Run your script with Xvfb to provide a virtual display. You can do this by prefixing your command with `xvfb-run`, like so:\n     ```bash\n     xvfb-run python main.py\n     ```\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the display-related error.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary.
