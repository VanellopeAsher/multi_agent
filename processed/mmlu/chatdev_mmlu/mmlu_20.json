This is common when running Python scripts on a remote server or in a headless environment (such as a server without a graphical user interface).\n\n### Summary of the Issue:\n\n1. **No Display Environment**: The error indicates that the Tkinter library cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which tells GUI applications where to render their windows, is not set.\n\n2. **Headless Environment**: You might be running the script in a headless environment where there is no graphical user interface available, such as a remote server accessed via SSH.\n\n### Possible Solutions:\n\n1. **Run Locally**: If possible, run the script on a local machine with a graphical user interface where Tkinter can access the display.\n\n2. **Use X11 Forwarding**: If you need to run the script on a remote server, you can use X11 forwarding to display the GUI on your local machine. This requires an X server to be running on your local machine and using SSH with the `-X` or `-Y` option to enable X11 forwarding.\n\n3. **Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to create a virtual display environment where Tkinter can render the GUI.\n\n4. **Modify the Application**: If running a GUI is not feasible, consider modifying the application to run in a non-GUI mode, such as a command-line interface, if applicable.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the display error."

The specific error, `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`, indicates that the application is attempting to open a graphical user interface (GUI) window, but it cannot find a display to render the window on. This typically occurs in environments where a graphical display is not available, such as when running the code on a remote server or in a headless environment (e.g., a server without a graphical user interface).\n\nHere are the key points to address the issue:\n\n1. **Environment Issue**: The error is not due to a bug in the code itself but rather an issue with the environment setup. The Tkinter library requires a graphical display to render the GUI, and the error suggests that the environment lacks this capability.\n\n2. **Possible Solutions**:\n   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical user interface where Tkinter can open a window.\n   - **Use a Virtual Display**: If you must run the application on a server or in a headless environment, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to provide a display for the application.\n   - **Remote Desktop**: Use remote desktop solutions that support GUI applications if you need to run the application on a remote machine.\n\n3. **Testing Environment**: Ensure that the testing environment has a display server running, or use tools like Xvfb to simulate one.\n\nBy addressing the environment setup, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the display-related error."

The specific error, `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`, indicates that the application is attempting to open a graphical user interface (GUI) window, but it cannot find a display to render the window on. This typically occurs in environments where a graphical display is not available, such as when running the code on a remote server or in a headless environment (e.g., a server without a graphical user interface).\n\nHere are the key points to address the issue:\n\n1. **Environment Issue**: The error is not due to a bug in the code itself but rather an issue with the environment setup. The Tkinter library requires a graphical display to render the GUI, and the error suggests that the environment lacks this capability.\n\n2. **Possible Solutions**:\n   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical user interface where Tkinter can open a window.\n   - **Use a Virtual Display**: If you must run the application on a server or in a headless environment, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to provide a display for the application.\n   - **Remote Desktop**: Use remote desktop solutions that support GUI applications if you need to run the application on a remote machine.\n\n3. **Testing Environment**: Ensure that the testing environment has a display server running, or use tools like Xvfb to simulate one.\n\nBy addressing the environment setup, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the display-related error.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete \"TODO\" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like \"<INFO> Finished\"."

It is built using Python's Tkinter library.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Question Display**: The application presents a multiple-choice question about government and politics.\n- **Answer Selection**: Users can select one of the four provided answer options.\n- **Answer Submission**: Users submit their selected answer to see if it is correct.\n- **Feedback**: The application provides immediate feedback on whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n- **Tkinter**: Tkinter is included with standard Python installations. No additional installation is required for Tkinter.\n\n### Environment Setup\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory.\n\n   ```bash\n   cd <project-directory>\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies**: Although there are no external dependencies required for this project, ensure your Python environment is set up correctly.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   The `requirements.txt` file is included for completeness but does not list any external packages since none are required.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. **Run the Application**: Execute the main application file to start the quiz.\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Interact with the GUI**:\n   - Read the question displayed at the top of the window.\n   - Select your answer by clicking on one of the radio buttons corresponding to the answer choices.\n   - Click the \"Submit\" button to check your answer.\n\n3. **Receive Feedback**: A message box will appear indicating whether your answer was correct or incorrect. The correct answer is also displayed.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n- **Headless Environments**: If running the application in a headless environment (e.g., a server without a display), ensure that the `DISPLAY` environment variable is set appropriately. The application attempts to set a default display if none is detected.\n\n- **Customization**: The application can be customized to include more questions or different topics by modifying the `create_widgets` method in the `MainApp` class.\n\nThis application serves as an educational tool for students and educators interested in government and politics.
