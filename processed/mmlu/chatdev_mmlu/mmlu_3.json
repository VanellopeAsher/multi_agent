A credit is allowed against this latter tax for any excise tax paid to the city by the drawer or his employer in respect to the maintenance of an artist's studio in the city. A gallery, located in a neighboring state, has been sending two itinerant artists into the city. Their practice is to draw a picture of a pedestrian, ask him to order a finished painting, and collect a payment of $2. 00. The drawing is sent to a studio, which frames it and mails the framed painting to the customer. The neighboring state does not impose a tax on artists' studios. The gallery challenges the constitutionality of the $100 per year excise tax that is imposed upon its itinerant artists in the city. The court will most likely declare this tax\n\n0. constitutional, as a valid ad valorem tax on interstate commerce.\n1. constitutional, since the tax was levied not on the commercial art business as a whole but on the local activity of drawing pictures.\n2. unconstitutional, since a state or municipality may not impose a license tax on orders for goods or services to be perfonned in another state.\n3. unconstitutional, as a discriminatory privilege tax.\n\nAnswer: \".\n\nModality: \"document\".\n\nIdeas: \"\".\n\nWe have decided to complete the task through a executable software implemented via a programming language. \n\nAs the Chief Technology Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software realizable, you should propose a concrete programming language.

The specific error, `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`, indicates that the Tkinter application is trying to open a window, but there is no display available to render the GUI. This typically happens when running a Tkinter application on a server or in an environment without a graphical display, such as a headless server or a remote terminal without X11 forwarding.\n\nHere is a summary of the issue:\n\n1. **Environment Limitation**: The error is not due to a bug in the code itself but rather a limitation of the environment where the code is being executed. The environment lacks a display server to render the Tkinter GUI.\n\n2. **Solution Options**:\n   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical display.\n   - **Use X11 Forwarding**: If running on a remote server, use X11 forwarding to display the GUI on your local machine. This requires an X server to be running on your local machine and SSH configured with X11 forwarding.\n   - **Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment for the application.\n\nBy addressing the environment setup, the Tkinter application should be able to run without encountering the display error."

The specific error, `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable`, indicates that the Tkinter application is trying to open a window, but there is no display available to render the GUI. This typically happens when running a Tkinter application on a server or in an environment without a graphical display, such as a headless server or a remote terminal without X11 forwarding.\n\nHere is a summary of the issue:\n\n1. **Environment Limitation**: The error is not due to a bug in the code itself but rather a limitation of the environment where the code is being executed. The environment lacks a display server to render the Tkinter GUI.\n\n2. **Solution Options**:\n   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical display.\n   - **Use X11 Forwarding**: If running on a remote server, use X11 forwarding to display the GUI on your local machine. This requires an X server to be running on your local machine and SSH configured with X11 forwarding.\n   - **Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment for the application.\n\nBy addressing the environment setup, the Tkinter application should be able to run without encountering the display error.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete \"TODO\" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like \"<INFO> Finished\"."

The specific error message is:\n\n```\n_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable\n```\n\nThis error typically occurs when you try to run a `tkinter` application in an environment that does not have access to a graphical display. This is common when running Python scripts on a server or a headless environment (an environment without a graphical user interface).\n\nHere is a summary of the issue and potential solutions:\n\n1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the script is being executed in an environment where there is no display available. This is often the case when running scripts on remote servers or in environments without a graphical user interface.\n\n2. **Potential Solutions**:\n   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the script on a local machine that has a graphical user interface.\n   - **Use a Virtual Display**: If you need to run the script on a server, consider using a virtual display server like `Xvfb` (X Virtual Framebuffer) to create a virtual display environment.\n   - **Remote Desktop**: Use remote desktop solutions to connect to a machine with a GUI where you can run the script.\n\n3. **Alternative Approaches**: If running the GUI is not feasible, consider modifying the application to run in a non-GUI mode or use a different method to test the logic, such as writing unit tests for the core functionality without the GUI components.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the `tkinter` application without encountering the `TclError`.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary. Now, use the format exemplified above and modify the problematic codes based on the error summary. Output the codes that you fixed based on the test reported and corresponding explanations (strictly follow the format defined above, including FILENAME, LANGUAGE, DOCSTRING and CODE; incomplete \"TODO\" codes are strictly prohibited). If no bugs are reported, please return only one line like \"<INFO> Finished\"."

The specific error message is:\n\n```\n_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable\n```\n\nThis error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter-based GUI application in an environment that does not support graphical display, such as a headless server or a terminal without a graphical interface.\n\nHere is a summary of the issue:\n\n1. **Environment Issue**: The error indicates that the environment where the script is being executed does not have access to a display server. Tkinter requires a display server to render the GUI components, and it relies on the `$DISPLAY` environment variable to connect to the display server.\n\n2. **Possible Causes**:\n   - Running the script on a remote server without a graphical interface.\n   - Running the script in a virtual environment or container that does not have access to a display server.\n   - The `$DISPLAY` environment variable is not set or is incorrectly configured.\n\n3. **Solutions**:\n   - If you are running the script on a remote server, consider using a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to simulate a display environment.\n   - Ensure that the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is correctly set if you are running the script on a local machine with a graphical interface.\n   - If you are using a container or virtual environment, make sure it is configured to support GUI applications.\n\nBy addressing the environment issue, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the `TclError`.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary.
