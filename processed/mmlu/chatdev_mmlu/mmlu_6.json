However, `tkinter` is a standard library in Python and does not need to be included in the `requirements.txt` file. The `os` module is also part of the Python standard library. Therefore, there are no additional external dependencies required for this project. However, if you want to ensure compatibility with a specific Python version, you can specify it in the `requirements.txt` file.\nHere is the `requirements.txt` file:\n```\n# No external dependencies are required for this project.\n# Ensure Python version compatibility if needed.\n# Example: python_version >= \"3.6\"\n```\nIf you want to specify a minimum Python version, you can uncomment and adjust the last line accordingly.
