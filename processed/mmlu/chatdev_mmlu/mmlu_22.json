This issue typically arises when you try to run a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) application in an environment that does not support GUI operations, such as a headless server or a terminal without a graphical display.\n\nHere is a summary of the problem:\n\n1. **Error Explanation**: The error message `TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable` indicates that the Tkinter library cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which specifies the display server to use, is not set. This variable is essential for GUI applications to know where to render their windows.\n\n2. **Environment Issue**: This problem often occurs in environments that do not have a graphical user interface available, such as remote servers accessed via SSH, or when running the script in a virtual environment without GUI support.\n\n3. **Solution**: To resolve this issue, you can either:\n   - Run the script on a machine with a graphical desktop environment where the `$DISPLAY` variable is correctly set.\n   - Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment for running GUI applications in headless mode.\n\nBy addressing the environment setup to ensure that a display is available, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering this error."

This issue typically arises when you try to run a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) application in an environment that does not support GUI operations, such as a headless server or a terminal without a graphical display.\n\nHere is a summary of the problem:\n\n1. **Error Explanation**: The error message `TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable` indicates that the Tkinter library cannot find a display to render the GUI. This is because the `$DISPLAY` environment variable, which specifies the display server to use, is not set. This variable is essential for GUI applications to know where to render their windows.\n\n2. **Environment Issue**: This problem often occurs in environments that do not have a graphical user interface available, such as remote servers accessed via SSH, or when running the script in a virtual environment without GUI support.\n\n3. **Solution**: To resolve this issue, you can either:\n   - Run the script on a machine with a graphical desktop environment where the `$DISPLAY` variable is correctly set.\n   - Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display environment for running GUI applications in headless mode.\n\nBy addressing the environment setup to ensure that a display is available, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering this error.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary.

It is designed to test knowledge about a specific philosophical question related to Tolstoy.\n\n## Main Functions\n\n- **Display Question**: The application displays a philosophical question about Tolstoy.\n- **Multiple Choice Options**: Users can select from four possible answers.\n- **Answer Submission**: Users can submit their selected answer to see if it is correct.\n- **Feedback**: The application provides feedback on whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Environment Setup\n\nThis application is built using Python and Tkinter, which is part of the Python standard library. Therefore, no additional packages are required beyond Python itself.\n\n1. **Install Python**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Verify Tkinter Installation**: Tkinter is included with Python, but you can verify its installation by running the following command in your Python environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m tkinter\n   ```\n\n   If a small window appears, Tkinter is installed correctly.\n\n## How to Use the Application\n\n1. **Download the Code**: Obtain the `main.py` file from the provided source.\n\n2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file using Python. You can do this by navigating to the directory containing `main.py` and running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Interact with the GUI**:\n   - The application window will display a question about Tolstoy.\n   - Four radio buttons will be available, each representing a possible answer.\n   - Select the answer you believe is correct by clicking the corresponding radio button.\n   - Click the \"Submit\" button to check your answer.\n\n4. **Receive Feedback**:\n   - If your selected answer is correct, a message box will inform you that your answer is correct.\n   - If your selected answer is incorrect, a message box will inform you of the correct answer.\n\n## Additional Information\n\n- **No Internet Connection Required**: This application runs locally on your machine and does not require an internet connection.\n- **Cross-Platform**: As long as Python and Tkinter are installed, this application can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nEnjoy testing your philosophical knowledge with this simple and interactive application!\n```\n\nThis manual provides a comprehensive guide for users to understand, install, and use the application effectively."

Here are the identified problems and their summaries:\n\n1. **Xvfb Not Found**: \n   - The error message \"sh: 1: Xvfb: not found\" indicates that the script attempts to use Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to create a virtual display, but Xvfb is not installed on the system. Xvfb is a display server that enables running graphical applications without a physical display. This is often used in headless environments, such as servers or CI/CD pipelines.\n\n2. **TclError: couldn't connect to display \":99\"**:\n   - This error occurs because the script attempts to connect to a display server at \":99\", but it fails due to the absence of Xvfb. The environment variable `DISPLAY` is set to \":99\", but since Xvfb is not running, the Tkinter application cannot connect to this display.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe main issue is the absence of Xvfb, which is required for running the Tkinter application in a headless environment. To resolve this, you need to install Xvfb on the system or configure the script to run in an environment where a display server is available. Alternatively, if running on a local machine with a display, you can remove the Xvfb setup code and run the script directly."

Here are the identified problems and their summaries:\n\n1. **Xvfb Not Found**: \n   - The error message \"sh: 1: Xvfb: not found\" indicates that the script attempts to use Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to create a virtual display, but Xvfb is not installed on the system. Xvfb is a display server that enables running graphical applications without a physical display. This is often used in headless environments, such as servers or CI/CD pipelines.\n\n2. **TclError: couldn't connect to display \":99\"**:\n   - This error occurs because the script attempts to connect to a display server at \":99\", but it fails due to the absence of Xvfb. The environment variable `DISPLAY` is set to \":99\", but since Xvfb is not running, the Tkinter application cannot connect to this display.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe main issue is the absence of Xvfb, which is required for running the Tkinter application in a headless environment. To resolve this, you need to install Xvfb on the system or configure the script to run in an environment where a display server is available. Alternatively, if running on a local machine with a display, you can remove the Xvfb setup code and run the script directly.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary.
