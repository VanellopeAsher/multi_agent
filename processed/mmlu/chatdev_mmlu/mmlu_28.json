This is because the script is being executed in an environment where a graphical display is not available or not configured correctly.\n\n2. **Potential Solutions:**\n   - **Run Locally with a Display:** If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical display environment.\n   - **Use X11 Forwarding:** If you are accessing a remote server via SSH, ensure that X11 forwarding is enabled. This can be done by using the `-X` or `-Y` option with the SSH command (e.g., `ssh -X user@host`).\n   - **Virtual Display (Xvfb):** For headless environments, you can use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X Virtual Framebuffer) to simulate a display. You can start Xvfb before running your application:\n     ```bash\n     Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x16 &\n     export DISPLAY=:99\n     python main.py\n     ```\n   - **Modify Code for Headless Check:** The current code attempts to set a default display with `os.environ[\"DISPLAY\"] = \":0\"`, which may not work in all environments. Ensure that the environment variable `DISPLAY` is set correctly for your specific setup.\n\nBy addressing the display connection issue using one of the above solutions, you should be able to run the Tkinter application without encountering the `TclError`."

A witness who was present during the accident gave a deposition but died shortly after.\n\n2. **Legal Context**: The question revolves around the admissibility of the deceased witness's deposition testimony at trial.\n\n3. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **Option 0**: Admissible as former testimony. This option suggests that the deposition can be admitted because it qualifies as former testimony, given that the witness is unavailable (deceased).\n   - **Option 1**: Admissible under certain conditions. This option requires that the testimony be more probative than other evidence and that reasonable notice was given.\n   - **Option 2**: Inadmissible due to confrontation rights. This option argues that admitting the deposition would violate the ski resort's right to confront witnesses.\n   - **Option 3**: Inadmissible as hearsay. This option claims the deposition is hearsay without an exception.\n\n4. **Legal Principles**:\n   - Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, former testimony is admissible if the party against whom it is offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony.\n   - The witness's unavailability (due to death) and the prior opportunity for cross-examination make the deposition admissible as former testimony.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is (0)."

Common examples of these applications include:\n\n**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**\n\n- Documentation\n\n- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database\n\n**🤖 Agents**\n\n- Documentation\n\n- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha\n\n## 📖 Documentation\n\nPlease see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:\n\n- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)\n\n- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)\n\n- Reference (full API docs)\n\n- Resources (high-level explanation of core concepts)\n\n```"

If you are running the application in a headless environment, you may need to install `pyvirtualdisplay`.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pyvirtualdisplay\n   ```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Running the Application\n\n1. **Start the Application**: Run the `main.py` script to start the application.\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Enter the Question**: In the application window, enter the legal question in the \"Enter the question:\" text area.\n\n3. **Enter the Options**: Enter the multiple-choice options in the \"Enter the options (separated by new lines):\" text area. Each option should be on a new line.\n\n4. **Submit the Question**: Click the \"Submit\" button to process the question and options.\n\n5. **View the Answer**: The application will display the determined answer below the \"Submit\" button in the format \"The answer is (X)\".\n\n### Example\n\nFor the provided legal question about the admissibility of deposition testimony, enter the question and options as described, and the application will determine that the correct answer is option 0: \"admissible as former testimony\".\n\n## Additional Information\n\n- **Headless Environments**: If you are running the application on a server or in an environment without a display, ensure that `pyvirtualdisplay` is installed to simulate a display.\n\n- **Legal Reasoning**: The application uses predefined legal reasoning logic to determine the correct answer. This logic is based on legal principles and may need to be updated for different types of legal questions.\n\nFor further assistance or inquiries, please contact the development team at ChatDev."
