The application uses the Tkinter library, which is part of the standard Python library, to create a graphical user interface (GUI).\n\n## Main Features\n\n- **Interactive GUI**: The application provides an easy-to-use interface for answering multiple-choice questions.\n- **Immediate Feedback**: Users receive instant feedback on whether their answer is correct or incorrect.\n- **No External Dependencies**: The application relies solely on the standard Python library, making it easy to set up and run.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).\n\n### Setting Up the Environment\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the source code to your local machine.\n   ```bash\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd <repository-directory>\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, install Python from the official website.\n\n3. **Verify Tkinter Installation**: Tkinter is included with Python, but you can verify its installation by running the following command in your Python environment:\n   ```python\n   python -m tkinter\n   ```\n   If a small window appears, Tkinter is installed correctly.\n\n## How to Use the Application\n\n1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and execute the following command:\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Answer the Question**: The application will display a machine learning-related question with multiple-choice answers. Select the option you believe is correct by clicking the corresponding radio button.\n\n3. **Submit Your Answer**: Click the \"Submit\" button to check your answer. A message box will appear indicating whether your answer is correct or incorrect.\n\n4. **Feedback**: If your answer is correct, the message box will confirm it. If incorrect, the message box will display the correct answer.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **GUI Issues**: If you encounter issues with the GUI not displaying, ensure you are running the script in an environment that supports GUI applications.\n- **Tkinter Errors**: If you receive errors related to Tkinter, verify that Python and Tkinter are correctly installed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Machine Learning Quiz Application is a simple yet effective tool for testing your knowledge of machine learning concepts.

The specific error message is:\n\n```\n_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable\n```\n\nThis error typically occurs when you try to run a Tkinter application on a system that does not have access to a graphical display environment.

This is useful for running GUI applications in environments without a physical display.\n     - Install Xvfb: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`\n     - Run your script with Xvfb: `xvfb-run python main.py`\n   - **Remote Desktop**: If you are accessing a remote server, consider using remote desktop solutions that provide a graphical interface, such as VNC or X11 forwarding through SSH.\n\nBy addressing the lack of a display environment, you should be able to run your Tkinter application without encountering this error."

This is common when running the application on a remote server or in a headless environment (i.e., an environment without a graphical user interface).\n\nHere’s a summary of the issue and potential solutions:\n\n1. **Issue**: The Tkinter library requires a display environment to render the GUI. The error indicates that the application is trying to access a display, but the `$DISPLAY` environment variable is not set, which is necessary for GUI applications to know where to render their windows.\n\n2. **Solutions**:\n   - **Run Locally**: If possible, run the application on a local machine with a graphical user interface.\n   - **Set Up a Virtual Display**: Use a virtual display server like Xvfb (X virtual framebuffer) to create a virtual display environment. This is useful for running GUI applications in environments without a physical display.\n     - Install Xvfb: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`\n     - Run your script with Xvfb: `xvfb-run python main.py`\n   - **Remote Desktop**: If you are accessing a remote server, consider using remote desktop solutions that provide a graphical interface, such as VNC or X11 forwarding through SSH.\n\nBy addressing the lack of a display environment, you should be able to run your Tkinter application without encountering this error.\"\nNote that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that \"FILENAME\" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, \"LANGUAGE\" in the programming language, \"DOCSTRING\" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and \"CODE\" is the original code:\nFILENAME\n```LANGUAGE\n'''\nDOCSTRING\n'''\nCODE\n```\nAs the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software execute smoothly and robustly, you should modify the codes based on the error summary.
