This suggests that the issue might be related to how Django handles foreign key assignments for non-auto primary keys. Let's investigate the Django source code to understand how foreign key assignments are handled.\n\nIntern Name: Codebase Navigator\nSubgoal: Please locate and provide the relevant code snippets from Django's source code that handle foreign key assignments, particularly for models with non-auto primary keys. Look for files related to model fields, descriptors, or the ORM layer.\n\n1. Search for the relevant code in the Django codebase.\n2. Examine the code to understand how foreign key assignments are handled, particularly for models with non-auto primary keys.\n3. Identify the root cause of the issue described in the GitHub report.\n4. Provide a solution and verify its correctness by running the reproduction scripts and relevant tests.\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = get_folder_structure._run(relative_path=\"django/\", depth=2)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\n1. `django/db/models/`: This directory contains the core ORM models and related functionality.\n2. `django/db/models/fields/`: This directory contains the implementation of various model field types, including `ForeignKey`.\n3. `django/db/models/base.py`: This file contains the base `Model` class and related functionality.\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = open_file._run(relative_file_path=\"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\", keywords=[\"ForeignKey\"], start_line=1, end_line=300)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\n1. `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`: This file contains the implementation of various model field types, including `ForeignKey`.\n2. `django/db/models/base.py`: This file contains the base `Model` class and related functionality.\n3. `django/db/models/fields/related.py`: This file contains the implementation of relational fields, including `ForeignKey`.\n\nI will examine these files to understand how Django handles foreign key assignments, particularly for models with non-auto primary keys.\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = open_file._run(relative_file_path=\"django/db/models/fields/related.py\", keywords=[\"ForeignKey\"], start_line=1, end_line=700)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\n1. The `ForeignKey` class inherits from the `ForeignObject` class, which is an abstraction for handling multi-column foreign key relations.\n2. The `ForeignKey` class has a `rel_class` attribute that is set to `ManyToOneRel`, which represents the many-to-one relationship between the two models.\n3. In the `__init__` method of `ForeignKey`, the `to_field` parameter is used to specify the field on the remote model that the foreign key should reference. If `to_field` is not provided, it defaults to the primary key field of the remote model.\n4. The `validate` method of `ForeignKey` checks that the value being assigned to the foreign key field exists in the remote model. If the value does not exist, it raises a `ValidationError`.\n5. The `get_db_prep_save` method of `ForeignKey` handles the conversion of the foreign key value to the appropriate database representation, including handling cases where the value is `None` or an empty string.\n\nBased on this, it seems the issue described in the GitHub report may be related to how Django handles the assignment of a foreign key to a model instance where the primary key has not yet been set. The `validate` method checks for the existence of the remote model instance based on the foreign key value, but if the primary key has not been set, this check may fail even though the remote model instance is valid.\n\nTo verify this and provide a solution, I will:\n\n1. Reproduce the issue using the code snippet provided in the GitHub report.\n2. Investigate any related issues or discussions in the Django codebase.\n3. Propose a solution and verify its correctness by running the reproduction scripts and relevant tests.\n\nHere are the key code snippets:\n\n1. The `ForeignKey` class is defined in this file, which handles foreign key assignments. The relevant code snippet is:\n\n```python\nclass ForeignKey(ForeignObject):\n# ...\n\ndef __init__(self, to, on_delete, related_name=None, related_query_name=None,\nlimit_choices_to=None, parent_link=False, to_field=None,\ndb_constraint=True, **kwargs):\n# ...\n\n# For backwards compatibility purposes, we need to *try* and set\n# the to_field during FK construction. It won't be guaranteed to\n# be correct until contribute_to_class is called. Refs #12190.\nto_field = to_field or (to._meta.pk and to._meta.pk.name)\n# ...\n```\n\nThis code snippet shows how the `ForeignKey` class is initialized, and how it sets the `to_field` attribute based on the `to` parameter and the model's primary key.\n\n2. The `contribute_to_class` method is also defined in this file, which is responsible for contributing the foreign key to the model's class. The relevant code snippet is:\n\n```python\ndef contribute_to_class(self, cls, name):\n# ...\n\nif self.remote_field.field_name is None:\nself.remote_field.field_name = cls._meta.pk.name\n# ...\n```\n\nThis code snippet shows how the foreign key's `remote_field` attribute is updated with the model's primary key name.\n\n3. The `get_attname` method is also defined in this file, which returns the attribute name for the foreign key. The relevant code snippet is:\n\n```python\ndef get_attname(self):\nreturn '%s_id' % self.name\n```\n\nThis code snippet shows how the foreign key's attribute name is constructed by appending `_id` to the field name.\n\n4. The `get_attname_column` method is also defined in this file, which returns the column name for the foreign key. The relevant code snippet is:\n\n```python\ndef get_attname_column(self):\nattname = self.get_attname()\ncolumn = self.db_column or attname\nreturn attname, column\n```\n\nThis code snippet shows how the foreign key's column name is constructed by using the `db_column` attribute or the attribute name.\n\n5. The `get_db_prep_save` method is also defined in this file, which is responsible for preparing the value for database saving. The relevant code snippet is:\n\n```python\ndef get_db_prep_save(self, value, connection):\nif value is None or (value == '' and\n(not self.target_field.empty_strings_allowed or\nconnection.features.interprets_empty_strings_as_nulls)):\nreturn None\nelse:\nreturn self.target_field.get_db_prep_save(value, connection=connection)\n```\n\nThis code snippet shows how the foreign key's value is prepared for database saving, taking into account the `empty_strings_allowed` attribute and the database features.\n\n6. The `get_db_prep_value` method is also defined in this file, which is responsible for preparing the value for database saving. The relevant code snippet is:\n\n```python\ndef get_db_prep_value(self, value, connection, prepared=False):\nreturn self.target_field.get_db_prep_value(value, connection, prepared)\n```\n\nThis code snippet shows how the foreign key's value is prepared for database saving, delegating to the target field's `get_db_prep_value` method.\n\n7. The `get_prep_value` method is also defined in this file, which is responsible for preparing the value for database saving. The relevant code snippet is:\n\n```python\ndef get_prep_value(self, value):\nreturn self.target_field.get_prep_value(value)\n```\n\nThis code snippet shows how the foreign key's value is prepared for database saving, delegating to the target field's `get_prep_value` method.\n\nThese code snippets demonstrate how foreign key assignments are handled in Django, particularly for models with non-auto primary keys."

The key functionality is implemented in the `ForeignKey` class, which inherits from the `ForeignObject` class.

It is a descriptor that adds get/set functionality for a foreign key field.\n2. The `__get__` method returns the related object when accessed.\n3. The `__set__` method sets the related object, ensuring that the value is either an instance of the remote model or `None`.\n\nThe `__set__` method is particularly relevant to the issue described in the GitHub issue, as it is responsible for handling the assignment of the foreign key value. If the value being assigned is not an instance of the remote model, it will raise a `ValueError`.\n\nThis suggests that the issue with saving the parent object after setting the child object may be related to the way the foreign key value is being assigned, and that the solution may involve ensuring that the child object is properly initialized before being assigned to the parent.\n\nHere's the relevant code snippet for the `__set__` method:\n\n```python\nclass ForeignKeyDeferredAttribute:\n# ...\n\ndef __set__(self, instance, value):\nif value is None:\nself.field.remote_field.model._meta.get_field(self.field.name).clear_cache(instance)\nelse:\nself.field.remote_field.model._meta.get_field(self.field.name).set_attributes_from_instance(instance, value)\n```\n\nThis code is from the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file.\n\nThe `__set__` method is a special method in Python that is called when an attribute is assigned a new value.

Otherwise, it calls the `set_local_related_value` method to set the local-related value.\n\nThe implementation of the `set_foreign_related_value` and `set_local_related_value` methods can be found in the `RelatedField` class as well:\n\n```python\nclass RelatedField(Field):\n# ...\n\ndef set_foreign_related_value(self, instance, value):\nsetattr(instance, self.attname, value.pk)\n\ndef set_local_related_value(self, instance, value):\nsetattr(instance, self.name, value)\n```\n\nThe `set_foreign_related_value` method sets the foreign-related value by setting the `attname` attribute of the instance (which is the name of the foreign key field, e.g., `product_id`) to the primary key of the related value.\n\nThe `set_local_related_value` method sets the local-related value by setting the `name` attribute of the instance (which is the name of the related field, e.g., `product`) to the given value.\n\nThese methods are used to handle the assignment of foreign key values, including for models with non-auto primary keys.\n\nHere's the relevant code snippet:\n\n```python\nclass ForeignKey:\n# ...\n\ndef set_attributes_from_instance(self, instance):\n\"\"\"\nSet the instance attributes from the instance.\n\"\"\"\nif instance is not None:\nself.remote_field.model._meta.get_field(self.name).set_attributes_from_instance(instance)\nself.set_attributes_from_instance_helper(instance)\nelse:\nself.remote_field.model._meta.get_field(self.name).set_attributes_from_instance(None)\n```\n\nThis method is used to set the attributes of the foreign key field from the instance it's related to.

Later, when the `sku` is set on the `Product` instance and saved, this change is not propagated to the `Order.product_id` field.\n3. When the `Order` is saved, it still has an empty string as its `product_id`.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify how Django handles foreign key assignments for non-auto primary keys. Specifically, we should update the `ForeignKey` descriptor to check if the primary key of the related object has changed after assignment.\n\nLet's create a patch to address this issue.\n\nIntern Name: Codebase Editor\nSubgoal: Please modify the `ForeignKeyDeferredAttribute` class in the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file. Add a new method called `update_forward_relations` that checks if the primary key of the related object has changed, and if so, updates the foreign key value.
