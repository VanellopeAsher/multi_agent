    "\t",
    "As pointed out by â€‹Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.",

It's likely to be in a file related to signals or dispatch.\n\nThought: To find the relevant file and code, I will use the provided tools to search for the `Signal` class and the `send_robust()` method.\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = code_search._run(names=[\"Signal\"])\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = code_search._run(names=[\"send_robust\"])\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\nThe search results provide some useful information about the `send_robust()` method, including its documentation and some test cases. However, to fully understand the issue and provide a solution, I will need to review the implementation of the `send_robust()` method and see if there are any known issues or discussions related to it.\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = open_file._run(relative_file_path=\"django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", keywords=[\"send_robust\"], start_line=181, end_line=214)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\nThe method first checks if there are any registered receivers for the signal. If not, it returns an empty list.\n\nThen, it iterates through all the live receivers and calls each one, catching any exceptions that may be raised. The responses from the receivers, along with any exceptions, are collected in a list of tuples and returned.\n\nThis behavior seems to match the description in the Github issue, where it is mentioned that the `send_robust()` method does not log exceptions raised in the receivers. The issue suggests that it would be worth adding a `logger.exception()` call in the `except` clause to log these exceptions.\n\nThought: To provide a solution, I will propose a pull request that adds the suggested logging functionality to the `send_robust()` method.\n\nFinal Answer:\nTo resolve the issue of missing log messages for exceptions raised in receivers of `Signal.send_robust()`, I propose the following solution:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\ndef send_robust(self, sender, **named):\n\"\"\"\nSend signal from sender to all connected receivers catching errors.\n\nArguments:\nsender\nThe sender of the signal. Can be any Python object (normally one\nregistered with a connect if you actually want something to\noccur).\nnamed\nNamed arguments which will be passed to receivers.\n\nReturn a list of tuple pairs [(receiver, response), ... ].\n\nIf any receiver raises an error (specifically any subclass of\nException), return the error instance as the result for that receiver\nand log the exception using `logger.exception()`.\n\"\"\"\nif not self.receivers or self.sender_receivers_cache.get(sender) is NO_RECEIVERS:\nreturn []\n\nresponses = []\nfor receiver in self._live_receivers(sender):\ntry:\nresponse = receiver(signal=self, sender=sender, **named)\nexcept Exception as err:\nlogger.exception(\"Exception raised in Signal.send_robust() receiver: %s\", receiver)\nresponses.append((receiver, err))\nelse:\nresponses.append((receiver, response))\nreturn responses\n```\n\nThe changes made are:\n\n1. Imported the `logging` module to add logging functionality.\n2. Added a `logger.exception()` call inside the `except` clause to log the exception raised by the receiver.\n\nThis solution will ensure that any exceptions raised in the receivers of `Signal.send_robust()` are logged, making it easier for users to identify and troubleshoot issues.\n\nHere are the key code snippets:\n\n**Signal class:**\n```python\n# django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\nclass Signal:\ndef __init__(self, name, receiver=None, weak=False):\n# ...\n```\n\n**send_robust() method:**\n```python\n# django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\ndef send_robust(self, sender, **named):\n\"\"\"\nSend signal from sender to all connected receivers catching errors.\n\nArguments:\n\nsender\nThe sender of the signal. Can be any Python object (normally one\nregistered with a connect if you actually want something to\noccur).\n\nnamed\nNamed arguments which will be passed to receivers.\n\nReturn a list of tuple pairs [(receiver, response), ... ].\n\nIf any receiver raises an error (specifically any subclass of\nException), return the error instance as the result for that receiver.\n\"\"\"\n# ...\n```\n\nThe `Signal` class is defined in the `django.dispatch.dispatcher` module, and the `send_robust()` method is a method of the `Signal` class, also located in the `django.dispatch.dispatcher` module."

      "content": "Before we make any changes, let's examine the full implementation of the `send_robust()` method to understand its current behavior and determine the best place to add logging.\n\nIntern Name: Codebase Navigator\nSubgoal: Please provide the full implementation of the `send_robust()` method from the `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py` file.\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = open_file._run(relative_file_path=\"django/dispatch/dispatcher.py\", keywords=[\"send_robust\"], start_line=80, end_line=110)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\n1. It takes a `sender` argument, which is the object sending the signal, and any number of named arguments to pass to the receivers.\n2. It checks if there are any receivers connected to the signal. If not, it returns an empty list.\n3. It iterates through all the live receivers and calls each one with the signal, sender, and named arguments.\n4. If any receiver raises an exception, the exception instance is added to the `responses` list instead of the receiver's return value.\n5. Finally, it returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the receiver and either the receiver's response or the exception instance if an error occurred.\n\nThis method ensures that if any receiver raises an exception, the other receivers are still called, and the exceptions are captured and returned in the response, rather than causing the entire signal dispatch to fail.\n\nFinal Answer: The `send_robust()` method in the `django.dispatch.dispatcher.Signal` class is responsible for dispatching a signal to all connected receivers, while catching any exceptions raised by the receivers. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the receiver and either the receiver's response or an exception instance if an error occurred.\n\n```python\ndef send_robust(self, sender, **named):\n\"\"\"\nSend signal from sender to all connected receivers catching errors.\n\nArguments:\n\nsender\nThe sender of the signal.

It sends a signal from the specified `sender` to all connected receivers, catching any errors that may occur during the process. The method returns a list of tuple pairs, where each pair contains the receiver and its response (or the error instance if an error occurred)."
