The current implementation is incorrectly identifying duplicate order_by clauses due to how it processes multiline SQL. To resolve this, we need to examine the relevant code in the SQLCompiler class, particularly the get_order_by() method. Let's start by locating the file and inspecting the code.\n\nIntern Name: Codebase Navigator\nSubgoal: Please locate the file containing the SQLCompiler class, which should include the get_order_by() method. It's likely in a file related to SQL compilation or query generation in the Django ORM.\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = code_search._run(names=[\"SQLCompiler\"])\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\nSince the issue is related to the behavior of the `get_order_by()` method when dealing with multiline RawSQL expressions, I will need to look at the implementation of that method in more detail to understand the problem and find a solution.\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = open_file._run(relative_file_path=\"django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\", keywords=[\"get_order_by\"], start_line=0, end_line=300)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\nThe issue description mentions that the `get_order_by()` method is incorrectly identifying duplicates in the `ORDER BY` clause when dealing with multiline RawSQL expressions. Let's take a closer look at the relevant parts of the implementation:\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = open_file._run(relative_file_path=\"django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\", keywords=[\"get_order_by\"], start_line=252, end_line=361)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\n```python\n# Don't add the same column twice, but the order direction is\n# not taken into account so we strip it.

Let's look at the implementation, focusing on the part that deals with identifying and removing duplicate clauses.\n\nIntern Name: Codebase Navigator\nSubgoal: Please show the content of the `get_order_by()` method in the `SQLCompiler` class from the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file. Pay particular attention to the part that uses the `ordering_parts` regular expression and the `without_ordering` variable.\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = open_file._run(relative_file_path=\"django/db/models/sql/compiler.py\", keywords=[\"get_order_by\"], start_line=720, end_line=766)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\n```python\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nparams_hash = make_hashable(params)\nif (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:\ncontinue\nseen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))\n```\n\nThis code uses a regular expression `self.ordering_parts` to extract the \"without_ordering\" part of the SQL query, which is then used to deduplicate the order-by clauses. However, the issue appears to be that this deduplication process is too simplistic and does not properly handle multiline RawSQL expressions.\n\nTo resolve this issue, it seems that the `get_order_by()` method needs to be modified to handle multiline RawSQL expressions more robustly, potentially by using a more sophisticated regular expression or by processing the SQL in a different way.\n\nThought: I don't have enough context to provide a complete solution, as I would need to understand the Django ORM codebase and the specific requirements of the feature better. However, I can provide some general suggestions:\n\nFinal Answer:\n1. Examine the implementation of the `get_order_by()` method in more detail to understand how it handles different types of order-by expressions, including multiline RawSQL expressions.\n2. Consider modifying the regular expression `self.ordering_parts` to better handle multiline SQL strings, or explore alternative approaches to deduplicating order-by clauses.\n3. Potentially add a unit test or integration test to reproduce the issue and verify the fix, to ensure that the behavior is properly addressed.\n4. If necessary, submit a pull request to the Django project with the proposed changes, along with a detailed explanation of the issue and the approach taken to resolve it.\n\nThe key is to thoroughly investigate the existing code, understand the problem, and then implement a robust solution that addresses the issue without introducing new bugs or regressions.\n\n```python\ndef get_order_by(self):\n...\nresult = []\nseen = set()\nfor expr, is_ref in order_by:\nresolved = expr.resolve_expression(self.query, allow_joins=True, reuse=None)\n...\nsql, params = self.compile(resolved)\n# Don't add the same column twice, but the order direction is\n# not taken into account so we strip it.

The `ordering_parts` regular expression is used to extract the column name from the SQL string."

      "content": "Thought: The problem lies in how the `get_order_by()` method handles multiline SQL expressions, particularly in the part where it tries to identify and remove duplicate order_by clauses. The current implementation uses a regular expression to extract the part of the SQL query without the ordering direction, but it doesn't handle multiline SQL correctly. Let's modify the method to address this issue.\n\nIntern Name: Codebase Editor\nSubgoal: Please update the `get_order_by()` method in the `SQLCompiler` class (file: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`) with the following changes:\n\n1. Add a new function to join multiline SQL into a single line.\n2. Use the new function before applying the regular expression to extract the order by clause.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n```python\ndef get_order_by(self):\n# ... (keep the existing code until the 'result = []' line)\nresult = []\nseen = set()\n\ndef join_multiline(sql):\nreturn ' '.join(sql.split())\n\nfor expr, is_ref in order_by:\nresolved = expr.resolve_expression(self.query, allow_joins=True, reuse=None)\nif self.query.combinator:\n# ... (keep the existing combinator code)\nsql, params = self.compile(resolved)\n# Join multiline SQL into a single line before applying the regex\nsql_oneline = join_multiline(sql)\n# Don't add the same column twice, but the order direction is\n# not taken into account so we strip it. When this entire method\n# is refactored into expressions, then we can check each part as we\n# generate it.\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\nparams_hash = make_hashable(params)\nif (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:\ncontinue\nseen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))\nresult.append((resolved, (sql, params, is_ref)))\nreturn result\n```\n\nThis change addresses the issue by ensuring that the entire SQL expression is considered when identifying duplicate clauses, even for multiline RawSQL expressions. The `join_multiline()` function removes newlines and extra whitespace, making it easier to apply the regular expression consistently.\n\nAction:\n```python\npatch = '''\ndef get_order_by(self):\n# ...

      "content": "Thought: The issue occurs because the `self.ordering_parts.search(sql)` operation doesn't handle multiline SQL correctly. We need to modify this part to join multiline SQL into a single line before applying the regular expression. Let's update the method to implement this fix.\n\nIntern Name: Codebase Editor\nSubgoal: Please update the `get_order_by()` method in the `SQLCompiler` class (file: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`) with the following changes:\n\n1. Add a new function to join multiline SQL into a single line.\n2. Use the new function before applying the regular expression to extract the order by clause.\n\nHere's the modified code for the relevant part of the `get_order_by()` method:\n\n```python\ndef get_order_by(self):\n# ... (keep the existing code until the 'result = []' line)\nresult = []\nseen = set()\n\ndef join_multiline(sql):\nreturn ' '.join(sql.split())\n\nfor expr, is_ref in order_by:\nresolved = expr.resolve_expression(self.query, allow_joins=True, reuse=None)\nif self.query.combinator:\n# ...

The `join_multiline()` function removes newlines and extra whitespace, making it easier to apply the regular expression consistently.\n\nThought: you should always think about what to do\nAction: the action as block of code to take\nObservation: the result of the action\n... (this process can repeat multiple times)\nThought: I now know the final answer\nthe final answer to the original input question\n\nFor example:\n\nQuery: Please modify the `remove_column` method in the `TimeSeries` class in `astropy/timeseries/sampled.py` to include a check for required columns. Add the following code at the beginning of the method:\n\ndef remove_column(self, name):\nif name in self._required_columns:\nraise ValueError(f\"Cannot remove required column name from TimeSeries object\")\nsuper().remove_column(name)\n\nThis modification will check if the column being removed is in the `_required_columns` list. If it is, it will raise a ValueError with a clear message explaining that the column cannot be removed because it's required. If the column is not required, it will proceed with the normal removal process using the parent class's `remove_column` method.\n\nThought: To modify the `remove_column` method in the `TimeSeries` class, I first need to locate the file and the specific method. Then, I'll use the editor to make the necessary changes.\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = open_file_gen._run(relative_file_path=\"astropy/timeseries/sampled.py\", keywords=[\"class TimeSeries\", \"def remove_column\"])\nprint(result)\n```\n\nObservation: Code output: The content of astropy/timeseries/sampled.py is: 1 # Licensed under a 3-clause BSD style license - see LICENSE.rst\n\nResults for keyword: class TimeSeries\n18 class TimeSeries(BaseTimeSeries):\n19\n57\n58\n59     _required_columns = ['time']\n60\n61     def __init__(self, data=None, *, time=None, time_start=None,\n62                  time_delta=None, n_samples=None, **kwargs):\n63\n64         super().__init__(data=data, **kwargs)\n65\n\nThought: It seems the `remove_column` method is not explicitly defined in the `TimeSeries` class. This means it's likely inherited from a parent class. We need to add this method to the `TimeSeries` class with the requested modification. I'll use the editor to add the new method to the class.\n\nAction:\n```python\npatch = '''\ndef remove_column(self, name):\nif name in self._required_columns:\nraise ValueError(f\"Cannot remove required column from TimeSeries object\")\nsuper().remove_column(name)\n'''\nresult = editor._run(relative_file_path=\"astropy/timeseries/sampled.py\", start_line=318, end_line=318, patch=patch)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nBegin!\nQuery:  Please update the `get_order_by()` method in the `SQLCompiler` class (file: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`) with the following changes:\n\n1.

When this entire method\n# is refactored into expressions, then we can check each part as we\n# generate it.\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nparams_hash = make_hashable(params)\nif (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:\ncontinue\nseen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))\n```\n\nThis code is responsible for deduplicating the order by clauses in the SQL query. It uses a regular expression (`self.ordering_parts`) to extract the column name from the order by SQL, and then checks if that column has already been added to the `seen` set. If so, it skips adding that order by clause.\n\nThe issue with this implementation is that it only looks at the last line of the SQL statement, which can lead to incorrect deduplication when dealing with multiline SQL statements like the one provided in the issue description.\n\nThought: To fix this issue, a potential solution would be to modify the `get_order_by()` method to handle multiline SQL statements more robustly. One approach could be to split the SQL statement by newline characters and check each line individually for deduplication, rather than just the last line.\n\nFinal Answer:\nTo fix the issue with the incorrect removal of order_by clauses when dealing with multiline RawSQL statements, the `get_order_by()` method in the `SQLCompiler` class from the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file could be modified as follows:\n\n```python\ndef get_order_by(self):\n# ... (existing code)\n\nresult = []\nseen = set()\n\nfor expr, is_ref in order_by:\nresolved = expr.resolve_expression(self.query, allow_joins=True, reuse=None)\nsql, params = self.compile(resolved)\n# Split the SQL statement by newline and check each line individually for deduplication\nlines = sql.split('\\n')\nfor line in lines:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(line).group(1)\nparams_hash = make_hashable(params)\nif (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:\ncontinue\nseen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))\nresult.append((resolved, (line, params, is_ref)))\nreturn result\n```\n\nThe key changes are:\n\n1. Split the SQL statement by newline characters using `sql.split('\\n')`.\n2. Check each line individually for deduplication using the `self.ordering_parts.search(line).group(1)` to extract the column name.\n3. Add the extracted column name and the `params_hash` to the `seen` set to track the unique order by clauses.\n\nThis modified `get_order_by()` method should handle the issue with multiline RawSQL statements more robustly and correctly deduplicate the order by clauses.\n\n```python\nresult = []\nseen = set()\n\nfor expr, is_ref in order_by:\nresolved = expr.resolve_expression(self.query, allow_joins=True, reuse=None)\nif self.query.combinator:\nsrc = resolved.get_source_expressions()[0]\n# Relabel order by columns to raw numbers if this is a combined\n# query; necessary since the columns can't be referenced by the\n# fully qualified name and the simple column names may collide.\nfor idx, (sel_expr, _, col_alias) in enumerate(self.select):\nif is_ref and col_alias == src.refs:\nsrc = src.source\nelif col_alias:\ncontinue\nif src == sel_expr:\nresolved.set_source_expressions([RawSQL('%d' % (idx + 1), ())])\nbreak\nelse:\nraise DatabaseError('ORDER BY term does not match any column in the result set.')\nsql, params = self.compile(resolved)\n# Don't add the same column twice, but the order direction is\n# not taken into account so we strip it.

The following changes have been made:\n\n1. The line:\n```python\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\n```\nhas been replaced with:\n```python\nsql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split())\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\n```\n\n2. This modification joins all lines of the SQL statement into a single line, removing any excess whitespace, before applying the regular expression.\n\n3. The change ensures that the entire SQL statement is considered when identifying duplicates, not just the last line, which resolves the issue with multiline RawSQL expressions in ORDER BY clauses.\n\nThese changes should fix the problem of incorrect removal of order_by clauses created as multiline RawSQL, as described in the original GitHub issue."

One approach could be to use a more sophisticated parsing mechanism, such as a SQL parser, to ensure that the entire SQL expression is properly captured and compared, rather than relying on regular expressions.\n\nAnother potential solution could be to modify the way the RawSQL expressions are constructed in the Django ORM, to ensure that they are always single-line expressions, or to provide a way for the user to indicate that a RawSQL expression should be treated as a single unit, rather than having its individual lines compared separately.\n\nUltimately, the best solution will depend on the specific implementation details of the Django ORM and the `SQLCompiler` class, as well as the broader context of the project and the expected use cases for the RawSQL feature.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe issue described in the GitHub report appears to be related to the way the `get_order_by()` method in the `SQLCompiler` class handles multiline RawSQL expressions. The method uses a regular expression to extract the last line of the SQL expression, which may not work correctly when the SQL expression spans multiple lines.\n\nTo address this issue, a possible solution could be to modify the `get_order_by()` method to use a more sophisticated parsing mechanism, such as a SQL parser, to ensure that the entire SQL expression is properly captured and compared. Alternatively, the way RawSQL expressions are constructed in the Django ORM could be modified to ensure that they are always single-line expressions, or to provide a way for the user to indicate that a RawSQL expression should be treated as a single unit.\n\nThe specific implementation details of the solution will depend on the broader context of the project and the expected use cases for the RawSQL feature in the Django ORM."

This regular expression fails to correctly handle multiline SQL expressions, leading to the removal of some ordering clauses.\n\nThe proposed solution is to modify the regular expression or the way the SQL expression is processed to better handle multiline SQL expressions in the ORDER BY clause.\n\nHere's the key code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef get_order_by(self, order_by):\n# ...\nresult = []\nfor expr, (sql, params, is_ref) in order_by:\nwithout_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)\nparams_hash = make_hashable(params)\nif (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:\ncontinue\nseen.add((without_ordering, params_hash))\nresult.append((resolved, (sql, params, is_ref)))\nreturn result\n```\n\nThis code snippet is from the `get_order_by()` method in the `SQLCompiler` class, which is located in the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file.\n\nThis method processes the ORDER BY clause and identifies duplicates by using the `self.ordering_parts` regular expression to extract the column name from the SQL string, and then checking if the resulting column name and parameters have been seen before. If they have, it skips adding the duplicate to the result list."
