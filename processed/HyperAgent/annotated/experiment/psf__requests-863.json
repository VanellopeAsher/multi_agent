    "Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument",
    "Currently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().",

      "content": "Thought: To address this issue, we need to first examine the current implementation of the `Request` class, particularly its `__init__()` method and how it handles the `hooks` argument. We should also look at the `register_hook()` method to understand how hooks are currently registered. Let's start by examining the relevant code.\n\nIntern Name: Codebase Navigator\nSubgoal: Please locate and provide the content of the `Request` class in the requests library, focusing on the `__init__()` method and the `register_hook()` method. Also, provide any relevant code related to how hooks are processed or consumed.\n\n1. Find the `Request` class definition in the requests library.\n2. Examine the `__init__()` method and `register_hook()` method to understand how hooks are currently implemented.\n3. Identify the issue with the current behavior, where lists are not properly handled as values in the hooks argument.\n4. Propose a solution to allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument.\n\nAction:\n```python\n# Find the location of the Request class\nresult = code_search._run(names=[\"Request\"])\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\nAction:\n```python\nresult = open_file._run(relative_file_path=\"requests/models.py\", keywords=[\"Request\"], start_line=42, end_line=662)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n\nTo resolve this issue, I will need to modify the `register_hook()` and `deregister_hook()` methods to handle lists of hook functions instead of just single functions.\n\nAction:\n```python\ndef register_hook(self, event, hook):\n\"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\nif isinstance(hook, list):\nself.hooks[event].extend(hook)\nelse:\nself.hooks[event].append(hook)\n\ndef deregister_hook(self, event, hook):\n\"\"\"Deregister a previously registered hook.\nReturns True if the hook existed, False if not.\n\"\"\"\nif isinstance(hook, list):\nfor h in hook:\ntry:\nself.hooks[event].remove(h)\nexcept ValueError:\npass\nreturn True\nelse:\ntry:\nself.hooks[event].remove(hook)\nreturn True\nexcept ValueError:\nreturn False\n```\n\nThe changes are:\n\n1. In the `register_hook()` method, if the `hook` argument is a list, we extend the existing list of hooks for the given `event`. Otherwise, we append the single hook function.\n2. In the `deregister_hook()` method, if the `hook` argument is a list, we loop through each hook function and try to remove it from the list of hooks for the given `event`. We return `True` if any of the hooks were successfully removed. Otherwise, we remove the single `hook` function and return `True` if it was found, `False` if not.\n\nThis should allow users to register and deregister lists of hook functions for each event in the `Request` class.\n\n**`__init__()` method:**\n\n```python\nclass Request(object):\n# ...\n\ndef __init__(self,\nurl=None,\nheaders=dict(),\nfiles=None,\nmethod=None,\ndata=dict(),\nparams=dict(),\nauth=None,\ncookies=None,\ntimeout=None,\nredirect=False,\nallow_redirects=False,\nproxies=None,\nhooks=None,\nconfig=None,\nprefetch=True,\n_poolmanager=None,\nverify=None,\nsession=None,\ncert=None):\n# ...\n\n# Event-handling hooks.\nself.hooks = {}\nfor event in HOOKS:\nself.hooks[event] = []\n\nhooks = hooks or {}\nfor (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\nself.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n\n# ...\n```\n\n**`register_hook()` method:**\n\n```python\ndef register_hook(self, event, hook):\n\"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\nself.hooks[event].append(hook)\n```\n\n**`deregister_hook()` method:**\n\n```python\ndef deregister_hook(self, event, hook):\n\"\"\"Deregister a previously registered hook.\nReturns True if the hook existed, False if not.\n\"\"\"\ntry:\nself.hooks[event].remove(hook)\nreturn True\nexcept ValueError:\nreturn False\n```\n\n**`send()` method, which uses `dispatch_hook()` to process hooks:**\n\n```python\ndef send(self, anyway=False, prefetch=None):\n# ...\n\n# Pre-request hook.\nr = dispatch_hook('pre_request', self.hooks, self)\nself.__dict__.update(r.__dict__)\n\n# ...\n\n# Pre-send hook.\nr = dispatch_hook('pre_send', self.hooks, self)\nself.__dict__.update(r.__dict__)\n\n# ...\n\n# Response manipulation hook.\nself.response = dispatch_hook('response', self.hooks, self.response)\n\n# Post-request hook.\nr = dispatch_hook('post_request', self.hooks, self)\nself.__dict__.update(r.__dict__)\n\n# ...\n```\n\n**`dispatch_hook()` function:**\n\n```python\ndef dispatch_hook(self, event, hooks, r):\n\"\"\"Dispatch a hook.\"\"\"\nfor hook in hooks[event]:\nr = hook(self, r)\nreturn r\n```\n\nThe `dispatch_hook()` function iterates over the hooks registered for a specific event and calls each hook with the `self` object and the `r` object as arguments. The `r` object is then updated with the results of each hook call.\n\nThe `register_hook()` method simply appends a hook to the list of hooks for a specific event. The `deregister_hook()` method removes a hook from the list of hooks for a specific event.\n\nThe `__init__()` method initializes the `hooks` attribute of the `Request` object with an empty dictionary and then registers any hooks provided in the `hooks` argument."

However, we need to ensure that the remaining `register_hook` method still supports our goal of allowing lists of hooks.\n\nLet's update the `register_hook` method one more time to support both single hooks and lists of hooks:\n\nIntern Name: Codebase Editor\nSubgoal: Please update the `register_hook` method in the `requests/models.py` file to handle both single hooks and lists of hooks. Here's the proposed change:\n\n```python\ndef register_hook(self, event, hook):\n\"\"\"Properly register a hook.\n\n:param event: The event to register the hook for.\n:param hook: The hook to be registered.

It then processes the `hooks` argument passed to the `__init__` method, iterating through the keys and values and calling the `register_hook` method for each hook.\n\nThe `register_hook` method is responsible for adding the hook to the list of hooks for the specified event:\n\n```python\ndef register_hook(self, event, hook):\n\"\"\"Properly register a hook.\"\"\"\nself.hooks[event].append(hook)\n```\n\nSo, the `__init__` method ensures that the `hooks` attribute is properly initialized and that any hooks passed in the `hooks` argument are registered with the corresponding events.\n\nThis implementation suggests that the original GitHub issue was likely caused by the behavior of the `register_hook` method, which only appended the hooks to the list, rather than handling lists of hooks correctly.\n\nTo address the issue, we would need to modify the `register_hook` method to handle both single hooks and lists of hooks, and potentially update the `__init__` method to process the `hooks` argument in a more robust way.\n\n```python\n75     def __init__(self,\n76         url=None,\n77         headers=dict(),\n78         files=None,\n79         method=None,\n80         data=dict(),\n81         params=dict(),\n82         auth=None,\n83         cookies=None,\n84         timeout=None,\n85         redirect=False,\n86         allow_redirects=False,\n87         proxies=None,\n88         hooks=None,\n89         config=None,\n90         prefetch=True,\n91         _poolmanager=None,\n92         verify=None,\n93         session=None,\n94         cert=None):\n...\n170         #: Event-handling hooks.\n171         self.hooks = {}\n172\n173         for event in HOOKS:\n174             self.hooks[event] = []\n175\n176         hooks = hooks or {}\n177\n178         for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):\n179             self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)\n```\n\nThis code snippet is from the `requests/models.py` file.\n\nThe `__init__` method of the `Request` class handles the `hooks` argument as follows:\n\n1. It initializes an empty dictionary `self.hooks` to store event-handling hooks.\n2. It iterates over a list of predefined events `HOOKS` and initializes empty lists for each event in `self.hooks`.\n3. It checks if the `hooks` argument is provided, and if so, it iterates over its items and calls the `register_hook` method to register each hook for the corresponding event.\n\nThe `register_hook` method is not shown in this snippet, but it is likely responsible for adding the hook to the list of hooks for the specified event."

      "content": "Thought: The current implementation of the `__init__` method is already capable of handling both single hooks and lists of hooks, thanks to our updated `register_hook` method. When the `__init__` method calls `self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)`, our new implementation of `register_hook` will correctly handle both single hooks and lists of hooks.\n\nHowever, to make the code more explicit and easier to understand, we can make a small modification to the `__init__` method to clarify that it supports lists of hooks.\n\nIntern Name: Codebase Editor\nSubgoal: Please update the `__init__` method of the `Request` class in the `requests/models.py` file to make it more explicit that it supports lists of hooks. Here's the proposed change:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self,\n# ... (keep other parameters unchanged)\nhooks=None,\n# ... (keep other parameters unchanged)\n):\n# ... (keep other initializations unchanged)\n\n# Event-handling hooks.\nself.hooks = {}\nfor event in HOOKS:\nself.hooks[event] = []\n\nhooks = hooks or {}\nfor (event, hook_or_hooks) in list(hooks.items()):\nself.register_hook(event=event, hook=hook_or_hooks)\n\n# ... (keep the rest of the method unchanged)\n```\n\nThis change renames the loop variables from `k` and `v` to `event` and `hook_or_hooks`, respectively. This makes it clearer that the value can be either a single hook or a list of hooks, which will be handled correctly by our updated `register_hook` method.\n\nNow, let's update the docstring for the `Request` class to reflect these changes and provide an example of how to use multiple hooks.\n\nIntern Name: Codebase Editor\nSubgoal: Please update the docstring for the `Request` class in the `requests/models.py` file to include information about using multiple hooks.

This implementation aligns with our goal of allowing users to register multiple hooks for a single event. Let's break down the changes:\n\n1. If the `hook` parameter is a list or tuple, it extends the list of hooks for the given event using `self.hooks[event].extend(hook)`.\n2. If the `hook` parameter is a single callable, it appends it to the list of hooks for the given event using `self.hooks[event].append(hook)`.\n\nThis implementation is exactly what we need to resolve the original issue. Now, users can register multiple hooks either by passing a list of hooks or by calling `register_hook()` multiple times with individual hooks.\n\nTo ensure that our solution is complete, let's review the changes we've made so far:\n\n1. We've updated the `register_hook` method to handle both single hooks and lists of hooks.\n2. The `__init__` method of the `Request` class already supports passing multiple hooks through the `hooks` argument.\n3.
